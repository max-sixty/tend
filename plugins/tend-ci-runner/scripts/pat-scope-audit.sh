# Reports bot PAT scope coverage against tend's required classic OAuth scopes.
#
# Classic PATs expose their granted scopes via the X-OAuth-Scopes response
# header. Fine-grained PATs do not — no documented GitHub endpoint reveals
# their permission set — so those are reported as STATUS=fine-grained and
# the caller should skip.
#
# Output (stdout): key=value lines the caller parses.
#   STATUS=ok | missing | fine-grained
#   GRANTED=<csv of granted scopes>    (ok, missing)
#   REQUIRED=<csv of required scopes>  (ok, missing)
#   MISSING=<csv of missing scopes>    (missing)
#
# Required scopes are duplicated in prose at docs/tend.example.toml,
# CLAUDE.md, plugins/install-tend/skills/install-tend/SKILL.md, and
# plugins/tend-ci-runner/skills/nightly/SKILL.md — keep in sync when adding
# a scope. This script is the one executable reference.
#
# Exit code: 0 when the check ran to completion (STATUS carries the result);
# non-zero only if gh or bash itself failed.
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated as the bot)
