"""Add completed workflow failure details to open Tend outage issues.

Annotations carry precise agent failures. Ordinary non-zero exits only produce
a generic annotation, so their useful diagnosis comes from the failed log. The
rendered sections and batches are bounded at semantic boundaries so GitHub can
always accept the comment and a later nightly run can continue where this one
stopped.
