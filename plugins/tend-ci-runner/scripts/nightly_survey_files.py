"""Select today's deterministic slice of tracked files for the nightly survey.

Both the day and the path pick a bucket by arithmetic, so bucket *N* returns to
the same file set every cycle. On a repository whose pull requests sit unmerged
longer than that, a path whose last pass left an open PR comes round again and
its findings get re-derived on the anniversary. So each path an open pull
request already changes is reported with the pulls covering it and who wrote
them, for the survey to read before it reads the file. The author decides where
a new finding goes: onto the covering pull request where the bot wrote it, into
a pull request of its own where anyone else did. The path stays in the list: on
the repositories where this fires the backlog can cover most of the tree, and
dropping those paths would leave them unsurveyed for as long as it stands.
