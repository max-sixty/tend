# Lists recently completed tend CI runs.
#
# Fetches runs started in the past 3 hours, then filters to only those that
# are completed and whose updatedAt falls within a 1-hour completion window.
# This two-step approach is needed because `gh run list --created` filters
# by *start* time, not *end* time — a run started 2h ago may have just
# finished, and a run started 50min ago may still be running.
#
# Window anchor: when invoked under a scheduled workflow with a simple
# hourly cron (`MM * * * *`), the completion window is anchored to the most
# recent intended cron tick instead of `now`. Consecutive cycles then tile
# exactly: [intended-1h, intended], then [intended, intended+1h]. Without
# this, GHA scheduler delay (20-40 min during peak hours) shifts each
# cycle's window relative to actual start time and drops runs that finished
# in the slack between consecutive actual starts. When GHA *drops* a tick
# entirely (not just delays it), the window's floor is instead pulled back to
# the previous actual run's intended tick so the orphaned hour still gets
# analyzed. For non-schedule events or non-hourly crons, falls back to a
# now-anchored 1h window.
