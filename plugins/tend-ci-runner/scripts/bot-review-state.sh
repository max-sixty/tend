# Resolves which of the bot's reviews actually anchors the PR's current head,
# and emits the answer as one JSON object.
#
# Usage: bot-review-state.sh <pr-number>
#
# Three GitHub behaviours make `.commit_id` alone unreadable, and every caller
# that reads a review anchor has to account for all of them:
#
#   Reply containers. Replying to a review thread (POST
#   /pulls/{n}/comments/{id}/replies) makes GitHub wrap the reply in a synthetic
#   zero-body COMMENTED review anchored at the then-current head. The newest
#   review record therefore routinely points at a commit nothing reviewed. A
#   review counts as *substantive* when it has a body, owns a top-level
#   (non-reply) inline comment, or is an APPROVED — containers are always
#   zero-body COMMENTED, while an empty-body approval and an empty-body review
#   carrying real inline findings both still anchor.
#
#   Force-push re-anchoring. A rewrite does not just move the head: GitHub
#   re-points earlier reviews' `.commit_id` at the NEW head. So a review of code
#   that no longer exists reports the current head, and `.commit_id` alone
#   cannot tell an ordinary push from a rewrite. Anything submitted before the
#   newest `head_ref_force_pushed` is discounted.
#
#   Unsubmitted reviews. GitHub returns the caller's PENDING reviews with a null
#   `submitted_at`. They anchor nothing, so the resolver drops them up front.
#
# Output (one object, all fields always present; absent values are null or ""):
#   head_sha            the PR's current head
#   last_force_push_at  newest head_ref_force_pushed timestamp, "" if none
#   last_substantive    {id, sha, state, at} — newest substantive bot review at
#                       any anchor, null if none. `sha` is unreliable when
#                       force_pushed_since is true; that is what the flag is for.
#   force_pushed_since  true when a rewrite postdates last_substantive — the
#                       commit the bot read was rewritten away, so its anchor
#                       now names the current head and every incremental keyed
#                       on it under-reports
#   at_head             {id, state, at, draft_mode} — newest substantive bot
#                       review anchored at head and submitted after the newest
#                       rewrite, else null. `draft_mode` identifies Tend's
#                       framed draft COMMENT so a later full pass may replace it.
#   orphan_id           id of the newest body-bearing bot review anchored at
#                       head post-rewrite, else null. A partially-failed review
#                       POST persists the body and drops the inline comments;
#                       this is the record to edit rather than duplicate.
#   fresh_approval_sha  commit_id of the newest post-rewrite bot APPROVED, ""
#                       if none — an approval that was genuinely earned
#   stale_approval_id   id of the newest bot APPROVED when that newest approval
#                       predates the rewrite, "" otherwise. Newest-then-test,
#                       never test-then-newest: the question is whether the
#                       approval now setting the PR's state is stale, so
#                       filtering first would name a superseded one and leave
#                       the live approval standing.
#   standing_approval_id  id of the bot APPROVED that currently sets the PR's
#                       review decision, "" when none does. Not keyed on a
#                       rewrite, unlike stale_approval_id: GitHub never lets a
#                       later COMMENTED supersede an APPROVED, so an ordinary
#                       push leaves the approval deciding the PR too. Only a
#                       dismissal (which rewrites the state to DISMISSED) or a
#                       later CHANGES_REQUESTED clears it.
