# Issue Triage

Triage a newly opened GitHub issue.

**Issue to triage:** $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Setup

Load `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci` first (CI environment rules, security). It will also prompt you to load any repo-specific skills (e.g., `running-tend`) — do so before proceeding.

Follow the AD FONTES principle throughout: reproduce before fixing, evidence before speculation, test before committing.

## Step 2: Read and classify the issue

```bash
gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json title,body,labels,author
```

Classify into one of:

- **Bug report** — describes unexpected behavior, includes steps to reproduce or error output. Descriptions of changed behavior ("no longer works", "used to work") strongly signal a bug even with a terse body.
- **Feature request** — asks for new functionality or behavior changes
- **Question** — asks how to do something or how something works
- **Other** — doesn't fit the above categories

## Step 3: Check for duplicates

*Skip for questions and other.*

```bash
# Search open issues for similar problems
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 50

# Check for existing fix branches and PRs
git branch -r --list 'origin/fix/*'
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName --limit 50
```

If a duplicate or existing fix is found, note it for the comment in step 7. Don't create a duplicate fix.

## Step 4: Investigate existing functionality

*Feature requests only.*

Search the codebase to check whether the requested feature already exists.

1. **Extract the core ask** — What specific behavior does the requester want?
2. **Search for implementations** — Grep for relevant function names, config keys, CLI flags, and domain terms.
3. **Read key files** — If searches find hits, read the relevant source to understand what already exists and how it works.
4. **Check docs and help text** — Look for user-facing documentation of the feature.

Record what you found (or didn't find) for use in step 7.

## Step 5: Reproduce the bug

*Bug reports only.*

1. **Understand the report** — What command was run? What was expected? What actually happened?
2. **Find relevant code** — Search the codebase for the functionality described
3. **Write a failing test** — Add a test to the appropriate *existing* test file that demonstrates the bug. Don't create new test files.
4. **Run the test** to confirm it fails. Use the test commands from the project's instruction files.

If the test passes (bug may already be fixed), note this for the comment.

If you cannot reproduce the bug (unclear steps, environment-specific, etc.), note what you tried and skip to step 7. Do NOT proceed to Step 6 without a failing test — a fix without reproduction evidence is not a conservative fix.

## Step 6: Fix (conservative)

*Bug reports only.*

**CRITICAL — gate check before proceeding:**

You MUST have a failing test from Step 5 before writing any fix. If you skipped the test (couldn't write one, environment-specific bug, etc.), do NOT attempt a fix — go directly to Step 7 and report the outcome you established.

**Only attempt a fix if ALL of these conditions are met:**

- Bug is clearly reproducible (test written in Step 5 fails)
- Root cause is understood
- Fix is localized (1-3 files changed)
- Confident the fix is correct

### Skill text fixes

When the bug is about bot behavior (e.g., "bot didn't use links", "bot posted wrong format"), the root cause is often a skill/prompt compliance issue, not missing code. Before adding guidance to a skill:

1. **Check ALL co-loaded skills** — Skills loaded together in the same workflow share context. If the guidance already exists in a co-loaded skill, the issue is behavioral compliance, not missing instructions.
2. **Don't duplicate guidance across skills.**

### Don't "fix" tests by adding skip guards

If the proposed change removes coverage for the failing scenario instead of restoring the assertion, stop. Smell patterns: a newly-added early-return at the top of the test (`let Ok(_) = X else { return };`, `if !path.exists() { return; }`), a fresh `#[ignore]`, a newly-inserted `skipIf` / `pytest.skip` keyed on the failing condition. The fix belongs in production code or test setup, not in a guard that makes the test bail when the bug fires.

### Don't pin undefined behavior in a test

When a doc claim and the code disagree and which of the two is wrong is still an open question, the finding *is* that question. A test asserting the current output settles it without the authority to — it turns unspecified behavior into a pinned contract, so the eventual fix arrives looking like a regression. Report the discrepancy and let a maintainer say which side moves; write the test after that.

### Defer to in-flight same-root-cause PRs

Step 3's duplicate check catches identical fixes. It misses the *same root cause class, different surface* pattern: several failing tests share one underlying cause, and an outstanding PR fixes some of them but not the one being triaged. When the triage analysis itself names an existing PR as same-root-cause, that's the signal to wait for it to merge and re-run, or to mirror its approach for the remaining sites — not to open a parallel narrow workaround.

### If fixing

1. Fix the root cause (not just the symptom)
2. Confirm the reproduction test now passes — that targeted pass plus a clean compile is enough local confidence to ship. Leave the comprehensive suite to PR CI per `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci`'s "End the turn only when work is shipped"; backgrounding a long suite before push risks ending the session while the result is still local.
3. Create branch, commit, push, and create PR:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/issue-$ARGUMENTS
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: <description>

   Closes #$ARGUMENTS"
   git push -u origin fix/issue-$ARGUMENTS
   ```
   Compose the body at `/tmp/pr-body.md`. Write for a maintainer deciding whether the current fix resolves the issue: explain the causal finding, the resulting behavior change, and the reproduction test that now passes. Follow **Reader-facing prose** in `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci`, and end with `Closes #$ARGUMENTS — automated triage` so merging closes the issue.

   The headings below are one possible shape when they help a reviewer scan the case. They are not a required outline; choose the structure that fits the change.

   <example>
   <bad reason="The headings are filled with a restatement, investigation chronology, and a generic test claim">

   Bad:

   ```markdown
   ## Problem
   The issue reports that retries fail.

   ## Solution
   I inspected the retry loop, compared several paths, and changed three files.

   ## Testing
   I ran the test suite.
   ```

   </bad>
   <good reason="The same headings carry the cause, resulting behavior, and evidence a reviewer needs">

   Good:

   ```markdown
   ## Problem
   A retry drops the resolved workspace root, so its second attempt reads from the process directory and fails outside the repository.

   ## Solution
   Keep the resolved root in retry state. Both attempts now address the same workspace.

   ## Testing
   The regression test reproduces the second-attempt failure before the change and passes after it.

   Closes #123 — automated triage
   ```

   </good>
   </example>

   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "fix: <description>" --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
   ```
4. Wait for CI per **CI Monitoring** in `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci`.

### If reproduction test works but fix is not confident

Commit just the failing test on a reproduction branch and open a PR:

```bash
git checkout -b repro/issue-$ARGUMENTS
git add -A
git commit -m "test: add reproduction for #$ARGUMENTS"
git push -u origin repro/issue-$ARGUMENTS
```

Compose the body at `/tmp/pr-body.md`. Make clear that the PR deliberately adds a failing reproduction without a fix, what behavior it captures, and any causal boundary already established so a maintainer knows what remains to decide. Follow **Reader-facing prose** in `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci`, and end with `Automated triage for #$ARGUMENTS`.

```bash
gh pr create --title "test: reproduction for #$ARGUMENTS" --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md
```

Note the PR number for the comment.

## Step 7: Comment on the issue

**Recheck before posting** per **Recheck Before Posting** in `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci` — triage can take minutes, so re-fetch the issue and skip any point a new human comment or a sibling tend workflow already covered.

Always comment via `gh issue comment`. Write for the issue author: lead with the current disposition, then give the causal finding and the action taken or the one concrete input or decision still needed. Link any fix, reproduction, or duplicate. Follow **Reader-facing prose** in `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci`; do not restate the report or narrate the investigation. Never claim the issue is fully resolved by automation alone — an opened fix still needs maintainer review and landing. Acknowledge the reporter when the situation calls for it, but do not use thanks or maintainer deferrals as fixed openers and closers. Do not present the bot's judgment as a maintainer decision.

Read the reporter's relationship to the repository before composing the reply:

```bash
gh api "repos/$GITHUB_REPOSITORY/issues/$ARGUMENTS" --jq '.author_association'
```

Omit a maintainer-deferral closer when `author_association` is `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR`; deferring to a maintainer reads as absurd when the reporter is one. For other reporters, a natural boundary can signal that the bot's action is not authoritative. This is a role distinction, not prescribed wording.

**Stay within what you verified.** State facts you found in the codebase — don't characterize something as "known" unless you find prior issues or documentation about it. Don't speculate beyond the code you read.

**Report the finding, not the search.** For a feature that plainly doesn't exist yet, "I searched the codebase and didn't find an existing implementation" only restates what the requester already knows. Lead with what they don't: the closest related code, where the change would slot in, or a tradeoff worth flagging. Mention searching only when the result is itself the news (e.g. the capability turns out to be computed internally but never surfaced).

**Apply the project lens** (priority 2 in the system prompt — project excellence outranks individual help). Before replying, ask what the issue reveals beyond this one reporter. If the underlying problem affects many users or the project's health — a false positive on a released artifact, a broken install path, a bad default, a misleading doc — foreground the durable, project-level fix, not just the individual's workaround. Take the pro-project action available to you (open a fix PR, or file/link a tracking issue for the durable fix) rather than handing the reporter only a personal stopgap. Deferring *prioritization* of the durable fix to a maintainer is fine; burying it under personal workarounds is not.

### Reply examples

These examples demonstrate tone, candor, and the boundary between the bot's work and a maintainer's decision. They are neither templates nor a complete list of outcomes. Match the actual issue's context and write the reply afresh.

<example>
<bad reason="The stock politeness carries no result, useful context, or concrete next step">

Bad:

> Thanks for reporting this. I investigated the issue, and a maintainer will review it.

</bad>
<good reason="Each reply acknowledges the person naturally, states the current result, and is honest about what remains">

Good:

**Fix ready**

> Thanks for the clear report. The second retry was dropping the resolved workspace root. #123 keeps it across attempts and adds a regression test; it still needs maintainer review before it lands.

**Reproduction only**

> I could reproduce this, but I don't have a fix I can defend yet. #123 preserves the failure as a regression test; the unresolved part is which layer should own the fallback.

**More information needed**

> I couldn't reproduce this with the configuration in the issue. Could you share the exact command and generated config file? Those are the two inputs that still differ from the failing path.

**Feature request**

> Thanks for spelling out the use case. This isn't available today. `--workspace` selects one root but cannot discover nested roots. The request fits beside that behavior; a maintainer still needs to decide whether discovery should be automatic or opt-in.
