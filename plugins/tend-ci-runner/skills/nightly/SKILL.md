# Nightly Code Quality Sweep

Three phases: resolve conflicts on bot PRs, review recent commits, and survey
a slice of existing code/docs.

## Step 1: Resolve conflicts on bot PRs

```bash
BOT_LOGIN=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
gh pr list --author "$BOT_LOGIN" --json number,title,mergeable,headRefName \
  --jq '.[] | select(.mergeable == "CONFLICTING")'
```

For each conflicted PR, dispatch a subagent to:

1. Check out the PR: `gh pr checkout <number>`
2. Merge the default branch: `git merge origin/main`
3. Resolve conflicts (read files, understand both sides), `git add`,
   `git commit --no-edit`
4. Push and poll CI using the approach from `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci`
5. If conflicts are too complex, `git merge --abort` and comment explaining
   manual resolution is needed

Run subagents in parallel. Each must work in isolation
(`git worktree add /tmp/pr-<number> <branch>`). After all complete, clean up
temp worktrees.

Skip if no PRs have conflicts.

## Step 2: Review recent commits

```bash
git log --since='24 hours ago' --oneline main
```

If no commits in the past 24 hours, skip this step.

Get the aggregate diff:

```bash
OLDEST=$(git log --since='24 hours ago' --format='%H' main | tail -1)
git diff ${OLDEST}^..HEAD
git log --since='24 hours ago' --format='%h %s' main
```

Review for: bugs, inconsistencies with existing patterns, missing/outdated
documentation, missing test coverage, dead code, non-canonical patterns,
CLAUDE.md/skill drift.

## Step 3: Check existing issues and close resolved ones

```bash
gh issue list --state open --json number,title
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName
```

For each open issue, check whether recent commits or the current codebase
state already resolve it. If resolved, comment briefly and close with
`gh issue close`. Skip partially unresolved issues.

## Step 4: Rolling survey

Run the survey script to get today's file list (~10 files, rotating through
the full repo over 28 days).

For each file, look for: bugs, stale documentation, dead code, simplification
opportunities, missing tests, CLAUDE.md/skill drift. Spend roughly equal time
per file.

## Step 5: Fix findings

Before acting on findings, check for duplicates and existing work:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --json number,title
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName
```

The default action is a PR, not an issue. If there's a plausible fix, make
it — explain uncertainty in the PR description.

For each finding:

1. **Create a PR** — branch, fix, run full test suite, commit, push and create
   PR using the fork-aware pattern from `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci` (check
   `$TEND_MODE`), poll CI. **Every bug fix must include a regression test that
   would have failed before the fix.** If a test is not feasible (e.g., pure
   documentation changes), note why in the PR description. When uncertain about
   the approach, explain the trade-offs in the description.
2. **Create an issue only when there's no obvious fix** — design questions,
   problems needing maintainer input, or findings requiring investigation
   beyond what the survey can provide.

## Step 6: Summary

Report: commits reviewed, files surveyed, findings, actions taken, assessment
(clean / minor issues / needs attention).
