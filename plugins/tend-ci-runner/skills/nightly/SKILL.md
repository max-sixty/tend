# Nightly Code Quality Sweep

Resolve conflicts on bot PRs, review recent commits, survey a slice of existing code/docs, and update tend workflows.

## Step 0: Load environment skills

Load `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci` first — it contains CI security rules,
polling conventions, and comment formatting guidance. It will also prompt you
to load any repo-specific skills (e.g., `running-tend`).

## Step 1: Verify bot PAT scopes

Run the scope audit script to check the bot PAT against tend's required classic OAuth scopes (`repo`, `workflow`, `notifications`, `write:discussion`, `gist`, `user`):

```bash
uv run --script \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pat_scope_audit.py"
```

The script prints `key=value` lines. Act on `STATUS`:

- `STATUS=ok`: all scopes present. Search open issues for a PAT scope audit tracking issue (`gh issue list --state open --search "PAT in:title"`); if found, close it with a comment noting the scopes are now granted.
- `STATUS=fine-grained`: no `X-OAuth-Scopes` header. Fine-grained PATs have no documented self-introspection endpoint — skip.
- `STATUS=missing`: open or update a tracking issue. Use a title containing "PAT" (e.g. `Bot PAT: missing scopes`) so future runs can dedup by title search. Before creating, run `gh issue list --state open --search "PAT in:title"` and update the existing issue with `gh issue edit` if one is already open. The body lists the values from `MISSING=`, names the secret to update (`TEND_BOT_TOKEN`), and links step 8 of the `install-tend` skill for remediation: https://github.com/max-sixty/tend/blob/main/plugins/install-tend/skills/install-tend/SKILL.md#8-bot-token-and-secret

## Step 2: Check tend configuration drift

Run `tend check` to verify this repo's tend setup (branch protection, bot
permission, and where credentials live):

```bash
uv tool run tend@latest check 2>&1 | tee /tmp/tend-check.txt
```

If **every** check line is `PASS` (no `FAIL` *and* no `SKIP`), close any
open drift issue. A run with only `SKIP` lines (e.g. lost API permission, a
transient `gh` error) is *not* a pass — leave the issue untouched, neither
close nor file. Scope to bot-authored issues so a maintainer-filed issue
that happens to contain "configuration drift" is never auto-closed:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --author '@me' \
  --search '"configuration drift" in:title' \
  --json number --jq '.[].number' \
  | xargs -r -I {} gh issue close {} --comment 'tend check now passes.'
```

If any check is `FAIL`, file or update **one** tracking issue with title
`tend check: configuration drift on <owner>/<repo>`. Dedup by title,
scoped to bot-authored issues:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --author '@me' \
  --search '"configuration drift" in:title' \
  --json number,title,body
```

No labels. Body lists the current `FAIL` lines (one bullet per check, with
a one-line reason) plus a `_Last refreshed: <YYYY-MM-DD>_` footer. Updates:

- **Failure set identical to the open issue** → edit body (refresh footer)
  only, no comment.
- **Failure set changed** → edit body to match current state and post a
  comment describing the delta (added/removed/changed checks).
- **No open issue** → create one.

## Step 3: Resolve conflicts on bot PRs

Load `/tend-ci-runner:resolve-conflicts` and resolve conflicts for this bot and
upstream dependency bots.

## Step 4: Review recent commits

```bash
git log --since='24 hours ago' --oneline main
```

If no commits in the past 24 hours, skip this step.

Get the aggregate diff:

```bash
OLDEST=$(git log --since='24 hours ago' --format='%H' main | tail -1)
git diff ${OLDEST}^..HEAD
git log --since='24 hours ago' --format='%h %s' main
```

Read the project's instruction files before reviewing. Apply the review checklist below to the diff, focusing on changes rather than unchanged code. Also check whether those instructions need updating to reflect the new code (e.g., new file paths, changed commands, removed patterns).

## Step 5: Check existing issues

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 200 --json number,title
gh pr list --state open --limit 200 --json number,title,headRefName
```

For each open issue, check whether recent commits or the current codebase state already resolve it. If resolved, comment with the evidence (commits, CI runs, or code state that resolves the issue). Close the issue with `gh issue close` when:

- The bot opened the issue itself to report a transient condition (e.g., a "Nightly tests failed" report from a prior run) and the condition has clearly resolved — the fix PR is merged and the relevant CI on `main` is passing. Skip this case where closing the issue is itself a signal rather than a record of resolution:
  - a body containing "Do not close manually" — recurring trackers with their own lifecycle.
  - the `tend-outage` label. Its rows identify failed runs that `review-runs` diagnoses before checking the live repository for missed work. Nightly's cron precedes `review-runs` under the generated defaults, so closing the issue here can remove those rows before that check.
  - the `tend-rate-limit` label, where a maintainer's close is what lifts the bot past its own rate limit. Closing that one as the bot lifts nothing — the preflight counts only closes by a person — but it clears a decision still waiting on one.
- The repo's guidance (e.g., `running-tend` skill) explicitly authorizes closing issues.

Otherwise, leave it open for a maintainer to close.

### Enrich tend-outage issues

The action's "Report failure" step records only a workflow run link in `tend-outage` issues — annotations and job logs aren't reliably available while the job is in_progress. Run the enrichment script to fetch failure details for each newly referenced run and post them as a comment. The script is idempotent: it skips runs already marked with `<!-- enriched-run:RUN_ID -->`.

```bash
uv run --script \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/enrich_tend_outage_issues.py"
```

## Step 6: Rolling survey

Run the survey script to get today's file list (rotating through the full repo over 28 days):

```bash
uv run --script \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/nightly_survey_files.py"
```

Skip files that aren't meaningfully reviewable: lock files (`uv.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, `package-lock.json`), binary assets, vendored dependencies, and generated files (build output, compiled protobuf, auto-generated workflow YAML). When unsure, check the file — a quick glance is cheaper than missing something.

Before reviewing files, read the project's instruction files and any project-specific skills or review criteria they reference. Apply the review checklist below to each file in full.

## Review checklist

Used by both Step 4 (applied to recent diffs) and Step 6 (applied to full files).

**General quality:**
- Bugs, logic errors, unhandled edge cases
- Dead code, unused imports, unreachable branches
- Simplification opportunities — unnecessary abstractions, indirection, or complexity
- Stale or incorrect documentation (comments, docstrings that no longer match behavior)
- Missing test coverage for non-trivial logic

A bug finding earns a PR only where a caller can reach it. For a defect found by reading rather than from an observed failure, name the in-repo call path that triggers it. If no caller can, the finding is a note in the Step 9 summary, not a PR — public visibility doesn't clear the bar on its own, since an item exported incidentally (a utility module under a default-on feature) promises nothing to anyone. Where it *is* part of a published library's documented surface, the fix stands: say so in the PR body, naming the contract rather than the visibility keyword.

**Convention compliance (from project instructions and skills):**
- Code patterns that violate conventions stated in the project's instruction files
- Stale instructions that reference renamed files, deleted functions, or outdated patterns
- Skills that have drifted from actual project behavior (instructions that no longer match how the code works)

## Step 7: Update tend workflows

Regenerate the Tend workflow files in a script-owned temporary worktree:

```bash
uv run --script \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/nightly_workflow_update.py" prepare
```

If it reports `changed: false`, it has cleaned up and there is no PR to open.
Otherwise its JSON supplies the title, old and new versions, compare URL, and
upstream commit subjects. It leaves the prepared worktree and state on disk for
the shipping command; do not `cd` into it.

Before composing the PR body, inspect `compare_url`'s diff for a new harness
model default. Update each explicit model pin in the prepared `.config/tend.yaml`
only when the replacement is a newer model in the same capability and price
tier, confirmed from the provider's model and pricing docs. Leave the pin
unchanged when those docs are unreachable or the tier is unclear, and preserve
cross-tier pins as product choices. After an edit, rerun generation without
moving this session's cwd:

```bash
( cd "<worktree from prepare output>" && uv tool run tend@latest init )
```

Compose the PR body at `/tmp/tend-update-body.md`. Its
reader is deciding whether to adopt the regenerated workflows, so explain the
consumer-visible effect of the upgrade rather than inventorying changed files
or commits. When the version changed, state the old and new versions,
synthesize the `upstream_commits` entries into the behavior adopters will
notice, and link `compare_url` as support. Rewrite each `(#NNN)` reference as
`max-sixty/tend#NNN` — a bare `#NNN` auto-links to this repo's own issues, not
tend's. Filter out release mechanics, action-pin and lockfile bumps, and
tend-internal work with no adopter-visible effect. If `upstream_commits` is
empty, the comparison call failed: include only the version line and compare
link, and do not infer upstream behavior. For a same-version regeneration,
explain the generator behavior that made the committed workflows stale. Follow
**Reader-facing prose** in `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci`.

Then ship the prepared change:

```bash
uv run --script \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/nightly_workflow_update.py" ship
```

The command commits, pushes, creates or updates the PR, records the pushed OID,
removes the temporary worktree, and prints the PR number and URL. Poll that
exact commit per **CI Monitoring** in `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci` — foreground,
`timeout: 600000`:

```bash
uv run --script \
  "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/poll_pr_checks.py" \
  poll <pr-number> "$(cat /tmp/tend-update-sha)"
```

## Step 8: Fix findings

Before acting on findings, check for duplicates and existing work:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 200 --json number,title
gh pr list --state open --limit 200 --json number,title,headRefName
```

That projection orients you; it does not clear a finding. It omits both states a prior rejection lives in — closed PRs, and the comment bodies of an open issue — so per finding, before writing code, run the searches under **Fetch the prior rejection before re-deriving a fix** in `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci`.

The default action is a PR, not an issue. If there's a plausible fix, make it — explain uncertainty in the PR description.

For each finding:

1. **Create a PR** — branch, fix, run full test suite, commit, push, create PR, then poll CI per **CI Monitoring** in `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci`. Your job ends when those checks are terminal: a review posted on the PR while you poll belongs to `tend-mention`. **Every bug fix must include a regression test that would have failed before the fix.** If a test is not feasible (e.g., pure documentation changes), note why in the PR description. When uncertain about the approach, explain the trade-offs in the description.
2. **Create an issue only when there's no obvious fix** — design questions, problems needing maintainer input, or findings requiring investigation beyond what the survey can provide.

## Optional steps

Not run by default. Only run a step here when the project's `running-tend` skill explicitly enables it.

### Changelog maintenance

Keep the project's changelog up to date with recent changes. The `running-tend` skill specifies the changelog file and the branch to push to.

1. Find the changelog file. If it doesn't exist, skip — don't create one.
2. Check out the changelog branch. Create it from the default branch if it doesn't exist yet.
3. Merge the default branch into the changelog branch to stay current. If the merge conflicts, delete the branch, recreate it from the default branch, and start fresh.
4. Identify merged PRs and notable commits since the last entry in the changelog.
5. Draft entries matching the existing file's style and format.
6. Commit and push directly to the changelog branch — no PR needed, the branch is kept ready to merge for the next release.

## Step 9: Summary

Report: commits reviewed, files surveyed, findings, actions taken, assessment (clean / minor issues / needs attention).
