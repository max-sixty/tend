# Review Runs

Analyze the previous night's tend CI runs in this repository. Identify behavioral problems, skill gaps, and workflow issues — then propose improvements to the repo's local skills and workflows.

This skill runs **in the adopter repo**, not in tend. Improvements target `.claude/skills/` and `.config/tend.toml` in this repository.

## First steps

Load `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci` first — it contains CI security rules, PR/comment formatting (line wrapping, heredoc hazards), and polling conventions. This skill opens PRs and issue comments, so those rules apply.

```bash
ls .claude/skills/
```

Load any repo-specific skill overlay before proceeding.

## Evidence accumulation

Each run only sees a window of CI sessions, but patterns emerge over days or weeks. Accumulate evidence in a **monthly tracking issue** labeled `review-runs-tracking`.

<!-- TODO: migrate this to gist-backed storage once the review-reviewers pilot validates it -->

### Finding or creating the tracking issue

`gh issue create` prints the new issue's URL; parse the number from its basename. Sort and pick the lowest-numbered match so later runs stay deterministic if the month ever has duplicate tracking issues.

```bash
MONTH=$(date +%Y-%m)
TRACKING_LABEL="review-runs-tracking"
TRACKING_NUMBER=$(gh issue list --state open --label "$TRACKING_LABEL" \
  --json number,title --jq ".[] | select(.title | contains(\"$MONTH\")) | .number" \
  | sort -n | head -1)

if [ -z "$TRACKING_NUMBER" ]; then
  cat > /tmp/tracking-body.md << 'EOF'
Monthly tracking issue for below-threshold findings. Each run appends findings as a comment. Future runs read these to build cumulative evidence.

**Do not close manually** — a new issue is created each month, and prior months are closed automatically.
EOF
  TRACKING_URL=$(gh issue create \
    --title "$TRACKING_LABEL: $MONTH" \
    --label "$TRACKING_LABEL" \
    -F /tmp/tracking-body.md)
  if [ -z "$TRACKING_URL" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: gh issue create failed" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  TRACKING_NUMBER=$(basename "$TRACKING_URL")
fi
```

### Closing prior-month tracking issues

Once a new month's issue exists, close any open tracking issues from earlier months. Run this unconditionally — it's a no-op when nothing's stale, and self-heals if a previous run failed to close.

```bash
gh issue list --state open --label "$TRACKING_LABEL" \
  --json number,title --jq ".[] | select(.title | contains(\"$MONTH\") | not) | .number" \
  | while read -r OLD; do
      gh issue close "$OLD" --comment "Superseded by #$TRACKING_NUMBER ($MONTH)."
    done
```

### Reading historical evidence

Before applying the gates, read the current tracking issue's comments to find prior observations that overlap with current findings:

```bash
gh issue view "$TRACKING_NUMBER" --json comments \
  --jq '.comments[] | {author: .author.login, body: .body}'
```

Also check last month's tracking issue (if it exists) for recent carry-over.

### Recording below-threshold findings

After analysis, find **the bot's existing comment** on the tracking issue and **append** new findings to it. If no bot comment exists yet, create one. This avoids notification spam from frequent runs.

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
BOT_LOGIN=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
EXISTING_COMMENT=$(gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/$TRACKING_NUMBER/comments" \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\")] | last | .id // empty")
```

If `EXISTING_COMMENT` is non-empty, check its size before appending. GitHub rejects comment bodies over 65536 characters — start a new comment when the existing one is too large.

```bash
# Verify the run heading references this run's $GITHUB_RUN_ID literally —
# fabricated round numbers produce dead Workflow links, see @review-gates.md.
# `|| { …; exit 1; }` rather than `if ! grep …`: the Bash-tool preprocessor
# rewrites `!` to backslash-bang and silently inverts the if-condition.
grep -qF "$GITHUB_RUN_ID" /tmp/findings.md || {
  echo "ERROR: /tmp/findings.md does not contain \$GITHUB_RUN_ID=$GITHUB_RUN_ID — refusing to post" >&2
  exit 1
}
gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/comments/$EXISTING_COMMENT" --jq '.body' > /tmp/existing.md
EXISTING_SIZE=$(wc -c < /tmp/existing.md)
if [ "$EXISTING_SIZE" -lt 50000 ]; then
  cat /tmp/existing.md /tmp/findings.md > /tmp/combined.md
  gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/comments/$EXISTING_COMMENT" -X PATCH -F body=@/tmp/combined.md
else
  # Comment approaching limit — start a new one
  gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/$TRACKING_NUMBER/comments" -F body=@/tmp/findings.md
fi
```

Never replace the body — prior entries contain per-run evidence needed for gate evaluation.

If `EXISTING_COMMENT` is empty, create a new comment. See the finding format in `@review-gates.md`.

## Step 1: Find recent runs

List tend CI runs that completed in the past 24 hours (the cron runs daily):

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
SINCE=$(date -u -d '24 hours ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
for workflow in $(gh api repos/$REPO/actions/workflows --jq '.workflows[] | select(.name | startswith("tend-")) | .id'); do
  gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/workflows/$workflow/runs?created=>=$SINCE&status=completed" \
    --jq '.workflow_runs[] | {databaseId: .id, conclusion, createdAt: .created_at, name: .name}'
done
```

If no runs found, report "no runs to review" and exit.

Then, for each run ID from above, pull its jobs and classify them:

- **Long-running** (>30 min): Tend runs typically finish in single-digit minutes. Anything over 30 is worth a look — download session logs in Step 3 and diagnose where the time went (long background waits, push-wait-fix cycles, a stuck tool call).
- **Near-timeout** (within 90% of the cap): A job that consumed most of its timeout budget is one slow external check away from being killed. These are **structural** failures: one occurrence is enough to act on.

To determine the timeout cap for a workflow, read `timeout-minutes` from the workflow YAML file (`.github/workflows/tend-*.yaml`). Tend's generated workflows do not set `timeout-minutes`, so GitHub's 360-minute default applies unless the adopter has overridden it via `[workflows.<name>.jobs.<job>.timeout-minutes]` in `.config/tend.toml`.

```bash
# Flag long-running and near-timeout jobs
gh api "repos/$REPO/actions/runs/$RUN_ID/jobs" \
  --jq '.jobs[]
    | ((.completed_at | fromdateiso8601) - (.started_at | fromdateiso8601)) as $dur
    | select($dur >= 1800)   # 30 min
    | {name, conclusion, duration_min: ($dur / 60 | floor), url: .html_url}'
```

After retrieving the timeout cap from the workflow file, flag any job whose duration exceeded 90% of it as a near-timeout. For the default 360-min cap, that threshold is 324 min.

## Step 2: Token usage report

Run the token report script to get per-run token counts:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/token-report.sh" 24 > /tmp/token-report.json
```

Pass additional workflow prefixes to include non-`tend-*` workflows that use the tend action (e.g., `review-reviewers`). Check the repo's `running-tend` skill for the list.

Include the totals and per-workflow breakdown in the summary (Step 7). Flag any runs with unusually high token usage for closer inspection in Step 3.

## Step 3: Download and analyze session logs

Load `/install-tend:debug-tend-run` for download commands and JSONL parsing queries.

Skip runs without artifacts. Trace decision chains: what did tend decide, what evidence did it use, what was the outcome?

## Step 4: Cross-check outcomes

For each analyzed run, compare what the bot did against what happened next:

- **Review runs**: Did subsequent commits undo something the bot approved? Did human reviewers flag issues the bot missed?
- **Triage runs**: Was the bot's classification correct? Did the issue get relabeled?
- **Nightly runs**: Did the bot's PRs get merged, or were they closed as unhelpful?
- **CI-fix runs**: Did the fix actually resolve the CI failure?

```bash
# Example: check if a bot PR was merged or closed
gh pr list --author "$BOT_LOGIN" --state all --json number,title,state,closedAt \
  --jq '.[] | select(.closedAt > "'$SINCE'")'
```

## Step 5: Deduplicate

Before creating issues or PRs, check for existing ones:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,body
gh issue list --state closed --json number,title,closedAt --limit 30
```

Search titles AND bodies for related keywords.

## Step 6: Act on findings

Improvements target **repo-local** files by default:

- **`.claude/skills/`** — update or create skill overlays with guidance that prevents the identified problem. Prefer updating existing skill files over creating new ones.
- **`.config/tend.toml`** — adjust workflow configuration if the problem is structural (e.g., wrong cron schedule, missing setup step).
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — add project-specific guidance if the problem is about code conventions or patterns the bot keeps getting wrong.

**Bundled-skill defects — ask permission before filing in tend.** If the root cause is a gap or bug in a bundled skill (`plugins/tend-ci-runner/skills/...` in `max-sixty/tend`) — the same pattern would fire in every consumer — open an issue in this repo requesting permission to file the same issue in tend. Include problem statement, run links, and proposed fix with code snippets (reused verbatim once approved). Signal: the fix reads as generic guidance that would apply to any consumer. On maintainer approval, open the tend issue.

**Prefer PRs over issues.** A PR with a clear description is immediately actionable.

The checkout's `.claude/` directory is bind-mounted read-only under the sandbox (protecting bots from modifying their own skills in place), so edits to `.claude/skills/` files fail with `OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system`. Do the edit, commit, and push from a git worktree under `$TMPDIR`, which is writable.

Claude Code's harness adds a second restriction on top of the read-only mount: `Edit`, `Write`, and Bash commands with `.claude/skills/` as a write-target argument are denied regardless of filesystem permissions ([anthropics/claude-code#37157](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/37157)). The guard checks argument text, so `Write(/tmp/…)` and `Bash(mv /tmp/… SKILL.md)` both pass — the second because `SKILL.md` is a bare filename inside the `cd`'d directory.

<!-- TODO(anthropics/claude-code#37157): once the harness exempts .claude/skills/
     as documented, replace the /tmp-then-mv dance below with direct `Write` to the worktree path. -->


```bash
git worktree add "$TMPDIR/review-runs-fix" -b daily/review-runs-$GITHUB_RUN_ID HEAD

# Use the Write tool to author each edited skill file to /tmp/<name>.md.
# Then move the files into place:
cd "$TMPDIR/review-runs-fix/.claude/skills/running-tend" && mv /tmp/running-tend.md SKILL.md
# Repeat per skill file being updated.

cd "$TMPDIR/review-runs-fix"
git add .claude/skills/
git commit -m "skills(running-tend): ..."
git push -u origin daily/review-runs-$GITHUB_RUN_ID
gh pr create --title "..." --body-file /tmp/pr-body.md --head daily/review-runs-$GITHUB_RUN_ID
cd -
git worktree remove "$TMPDIR/review-runs-fix" --force
```

`.config/tend.toml` and `CLAUDE.md` are not under the read-only mount, but if you're already in the worktree for a `.claude/skills/` edit, do those edits there too so the branch stays self-contained.

- **PR** (default): Branch `daily/review-runs-$GITHUB_RUN_ID`, fix, commit, push, create with label `review-runs`. Put full analysis in PR description (run IDs, log excerpts, root cause, gate assessment).
- **Issue** (fallback): Only for problems too large or ambiguous to fix directly.

**Limit to at most 2 PRs per run.** Pick the highest-confidence findings; note the rest in the tracking issue.

## Step 7: Summary

If no problems found (or none passed the gates), report "all clear" with: runs analyzed, sessions reviewed, brief quality assessment, and any below-threshold findings recorded in the tracking issue.

Save the summary to `/tmp/claude/step-summary.md` (a post-Claude step copies this into the GitHub Actions step summary):

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/claude
cat > /tmp/claude/step-summary.md << 'EOF'
## Review-runs summary
...
EOF
```
