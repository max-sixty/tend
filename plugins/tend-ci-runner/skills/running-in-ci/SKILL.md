# Running in CI

## First Steps — Load Repo-Specific Guidance

Most repos have a project-specific overlay skill (typically `running-tend`) with project-specific
CI context — which workflows tend-ci-fix watches, PR title conventions, label policies. If a
`running-tend` skill is listed in your available skills, load it with the Skill tool before doing
anything else.

Repo-local skills are invoked by their unprefixed name — `Skill: running-tend`, not
`Skill: tend-ci-runner:running-tend` (that prefix is reserved for this plugin's own skills, and
trying it returns `Unknown skill`).

Repo-local skills must have YAML frontmatter (`name` + `description`) to be auto-discovered.

If you are going to propose a code fix for a bug, load `/tend-ci-runner:triage` first — it
contains reproduction and testing gates that apply to all fix attempts, not just initial triage.

## Conduct

Follow the project's code of conduct. Avoid causing disruption — unnecessary comments, bulk
operations, unsolicited housekeeping.

### Helping vs. directing

Anyone can ask for help with a problem they raise: investigating a bug, answering a question,
creating an issue or PR to address it. These are proposals — a maintainer still decides what to
merge or act on.

Directing the bot to affect someone else's work — closing, reopening, or locking issues/PRs,
dismissing reviews, reverting commits, applying or removing labels — requires maintainer access. Before
complying, check the requester's `author_association` via the event payload or API:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/comments/{comment_id} --jq '.author_association'
```

`OWNER`, `MEMBER`, and `COLLABORATOR` indicate maintainer access. For anyone else, briefly explain
that a maintainer needs to make that call.

The test: "Am I helping this person with something they raised, or following a directive that
affects someone else's work?"

Repo-specific guidance (loaded via `running-tend` or equivalent) always takes precedence over these
defaults. If a repo's skill explicitly authorizes an action (e.g., closing duplicate issues during
triage), follow the repo-specific instruction.

## Read Context

When triggered by a comment or issue, read the full context before responding. The prompt provides
a URL — extract the PR/issue number from it.

For PRs:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,comments,reviews,state,statusCheckRollup
gh pr diff <number>
gh pr checks <number>
```

For issues:

```bash
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,comments,state
```

Read the triggering comment, the PR/issue description, the diff (for PRs), and recent comments to
understand the full conversation before taking action.

## Restrictions

- **Secrets**: Never run commands that expose secrets (`env`, `printenv`, `set`, `export`,
  `cat`/`echo` on credential files). Never include tokens or credentials in responses or comments.
- **Merging**: Never merge PRs or enable auto-merge (`gh pr merge`, `gh pr merge --auto`). PRs are
  proposals — a maintainer decides when to merge.
- **Scope**: Do not create issues, PRs, or comments in repositories outside the organization, unless
  the target repo explicitly welcomes AI-created issues (e.g., in its CONTRIBUTING guide).
- **Hanging commands**: Never use `gh run watch` or `gh pr checks --watch` — both hang indefinitely.
  Poll with `gh pr checks` in a loop instead.

## PR Creation

When asked to create a PR, use `gh pr create` directly.

Before creating a branch or PR, check for existing work:

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName --jq '.[] | "#\(.number) [\(.headRefName)]: \(.title)"'
git branch -r --list 'origin/fix/*'
```

If an existing PR addresses the same problem, work on that PR instead.

## Pushing to PR Branches

Always use `git push` without specifying a remote — `gh pr checkout` configures tracking to the
correct remote, including for fork PRs. Specifying `origin` explicitly can push to the wrong place.

If pushing fails (fork PR with edits disabled), fall back to posting code snippets in a comment.
Don't reference commit SHAs from temporary branches — post code inline.

## Merging Upstream into PR Branches

When asked to merge the default branch into a PR branch:

1. **Never use `--allow-unrelated-histories`.** If `git merge` fails because git can't find a
   merge base, the checkout is broken — investigate rather than forcing the merge.
   `--allow-unrelated-histories` treats both sides as disconnected, creating add/add conflicts in
   every file.

2. **Handle untracked file conflicts properly.** If `git merge origin/main` fails because
   untracked files would be overwritten by tracked files, stash them first — don't delete them:
   ```bash
   git stash --include-untracked
   git merge origin/main
   git stash pop
   ```

3. **Verify merge base exists** before merging:
   ```bash
   git merge-base origin/main HEAD
   ```
   If this fails, the branch history is disconnected. Re-checkout the PR with full history
   (`fetch-depth: 0`) before retrying.

4. **Resolve content conflicts in place — never `git checkout --ours/--theirs <file>`.** Those
   commands replace the *entire* file with one side's blob, silently dropping any non-conflicting
   changes from the other side that git already auto-merged into the file. The result looks clean
   (no conflict markers, `git status` shows the file resolved) but you've quietly reverted unrelated
   improvements from `main` — and the loss is invisible until someone diffs against `main` later.
   To keep "ours" *only* for the conflicted hunk while preserving auto-merged content, edit the
   conflict markers in place. If you genuinely want a per-hunk "favor ours" policy across the whole
   merge, pass `-X ours` at merge time (`git merge -X ours origin/main`) — it resolves conflicting
   hunks in favor of HEAD without discarding auto-merged content.

## CI Monitoring

After pushing, wait for CI before reporting completion.

**Use `run_in_background: true`** for the polling loop so it does not block the session. When the
background task completes you will be notified — check the result and take any follow-up action
(dismiss approval, post analysis) at that point.

```bash
# Run with Bash tool's run_in_background: true
# Filter out the current workflow ($GITHUB_WORKFLOW) — it will always show as
# "pending" since it IS the running job. Watching yourself deadlocks.
# Use `||` rather than `if`-based negation. The Bash tool escapes the
# exclamation mark to a literal backslash-exclamation, which prevents bash
# from recognizing the pipeline-negation reserved word and leaves the loop
# stuck until the 10-minute timeout.
for i in $(seq 1 10); do
  sleep 60
  gh pr checks <number> --required 2>&1 | grep -v "$GITHUB_WORKFLOW" | grep -q 'pending\|queued\|in_progress' || {
    gh pr checks <number> --required
    exit 0
  }
done
echo "CI still running after 10 minutes"
exit 1
```

1. Poll `gh pr checks <number> --required` every 60 seconds until all required checks complete
   (up to ~10 minutes). Ignore non-required checks (benchmarks). **Filter out
   `$GITHUB_WORKFLOW`** — the current workflow's own check is always pending while polling and must
   be excluded to avoid a deadlock.
2. If a required check fails, diagnose with `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`, fix, commit,
   push, repeat.
3. Report completion only after all required checks pass.

Before dismissing local test failures as "pre-existing", check main branch CI:

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs?branch=main&status=completed&per_page=3" \
  --jq '.workflow_runs[] | {conclusion, created_at: .created_at}'
```

If you cannot verify, say "I haven't confirmed whether these failures are pre-existing."

## Replying to Comments

Reply in context rather than creating new top-level comments:

- **Inline review comments** (`#discussion_r`): To read a single review comment, use the comment
  ID **without** the PR number in the path:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id}
  ```
  To reply:
  ```bash
  cat > /tmp/reply.md << 'EOF'
  Your response here
  EOF
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
    -F body=@/tmp/reply.md
  ```

- **Review events with inline comments** (review ID in prompt): A review may include inline
  comments. Fetch them by review ID and reply to each individually:
  ```bash
  gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/reviews/{review_id}/comments \
    --jq '.[] | {id: .id, path: .path, body: .body}'
  ```
  Reply to each comment using the inline review comment reply endpoint above.

- **Conversation comments** (`#issuecomment-`): Post a regular comment (GitHub doesn't support
  threading).

## Multi-way Conversations

Before responding, check how many distinct other participants are in the conversation.

- **Two-party** (you and one other participant): respond normally.
- **Multi-way** (multiple other participants): apply a stricter bar — only respond with concrete new information no one else provided: a code fix, reproduction, or specific technical detail.

Do not:
- Restate, agree with, or summarize what another participant just said
- Post "makes sense" or "good point" agreement comments
- Echo a user's findings back to them ("Good find!", "That's the smoking gun!")

A comment that responds to concerns you raised in a review is directed at you — briefly
acknowledge resolution or explain why concerns remain.

If a maintainer has already addressed the point, exit silently unless you can add something they missed.

## Self-conversation Guard

If you are responding to your own prior comment or review (not a human's reply to it), only
respond if there is a distinct role boundary (e.g., you are the reviewer on your own PR and need
to address review feedback). If there is no such role distinction, exit silently to avoid
self-conversation loops.

## Recheck Before Posting

**Before posting any comment or review**, re-fetch the current conversation state. Other
participants may comment while you work — even in short sessions, context can change between when
you read a thread and when you reply:

```bash
# For issues
gh issue view <number> --json comments --jq '.comments | length'

# For PRs (comments + reviews)
gh pr view <number> --json comments,reviews \
  --jq '{comments: (.comments | length), reviews: (.reviews | length)}'
```

Compare with the count you saw when you first read the context. If new comments or reviews
appeared:

1. **Read the new comments** to understand what changed.
2. **Adjust or skip your response.** If someone already answered, don't repeat them. If the author
   resolved the issue, acknowledge that instead of posting a stale analysis. If new information
   contradicts your findings, update your response before posting.
3. **If your response is now entirely redundant, don't post it.**

### Dedup check for inline review comment replies

A single PR review can fire both `pull_request_review` and `pull_request_review_comment` events,
triggering separate workflow runs (serialized by the concurrency group, not truly concurrent).
Before replying to an inline review comment, check whether the bot already replied:

```bash
BOT_LOGIN=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
EXISTING=$(gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments?per_page=100" \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.in_reply_to_id == {comment_id} and .user.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\")] | length")
```

If `EXISTING` is greater than 0, **do not post** — another run already handled this comment. Exit
silently.

## Comment Formatting

**Line wrapping:** GitHub renders newlines literally in issue bodies, PR descriptions, and
comments — a line break in the source becomes a `<br>` in the output. Write each paragraph as a
single long line and let the browser reflow. Hard wraps at 72–80 chars create awkward mid-sentence
breaks on GitHub. (This applies to GitHub-rendered content only, not to skill files or code.)

Keep comments concise. Put supporting detail inside `<details>` tags — the reader should get the
gist without expanding. Don't collapse content that *is* the answer (e.g., a requested analysis).

```
<details><summary>Detailed findings (6 files)</summary>

...details here...

</details>
```

Always use markdown links for files, issues, PRs, and docs. Prefer permalinks (commit SHA URLs)
over branch-based links for line references — line numbers shift and `blob/main/...#L42` links go
stale.

**GitHub URLs — always embed `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.** Construct links as
`https://github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/...`; never hand-type the owner. The model reliably
guesses wrong — past comments have shipped with `anthropics/worktrunk` and `worktrunk/worktrunk`
on a repo actually owned by `max-sixty`. Before posting a comment, scan it for `github.com/` and
confirm every owner matches `$GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.

- **Files**: link to GitHub (`blob/main/...` for file-level, `blob/<sha>/...#L42` for lines)
- **Issues/PRs**: `#123` shorthand
- **External**: `[text](url)` format

Don't add job links or footers — `claude-code-action` adds these automatically.

## Keeping PR Titles and Descriptions Current

When revising code after review feedback, update the title and description if the approach changed:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number} -X PATCH \
  -f title="new title" -F body=@/tmp/updated-body.md
```

## Atomic PRs

Split unrelated changes into separate PRs — one concern per PR. If one change could be reverted
without affecting the other, they belong in separate PRs.

## Investigating Other CI Runs

Load `/install-tend:debug-ci-session` for session log download, JSONL parsing queries, and
diagnostic workflow. The primary evidence for diagnosing bot behavior is the session log
artifact — not console output.

Review-response runs triggered by `pull_request_review` or `pull_request_review_comment` events
sometimes produce no artifact when the session is very short.

## Grounded Analysis

CI runs are not interactive — every claim must be grounded in evidence. The user can't ask
follow-up questions; treat every response as your final answer.

Read logs, code, and API data before drawing conclusions. Show evidence: cite log lines, file
paths, commit SHAs. Trace causation — if two things co-occur, find the mechanism rather than
saying "this may be related." Never claim a failure is "pre-existing" without checking main branch
CI history. Distinguish what you verified from what you inferred.

### User-facing comments require source evidence

Public comments — on issues, PRs, or in review threads — are permanent and visible. A
hallucinated detail (wrong syntax, invented API, nonexistent flag) misleads users and erodes
trust. **It is always better to take longer and produce a correct response than to respond quickly
with fabricated details.**

Before posting any specific claim — a configuration snippet, command syntax, variable name, or API
behavior — find the **source text** that confirms it. Source text means documentation, help output,
test expectations, or the code that implements the public interface. Internal implementation code
(struct fields, variable names in Rust/Python/etc.) shows what exists internally but not how it's
exposed to users — read the docs or user-facing layer too.

<example>
<bad reason="Read Rust code showing a 'target' variable and invented $WT_TARGET">

Bad: Saw `extra_vars.push(("target", target_branch))` in Rust source → posted a hook example
using `$WT_TARGET` (an environment variable that doesn't exist — hooks use `{{ target }}` Jinja
templates).

</bad>
<good reason="Verified syntax against user-facing documentation before posting">

Good: Saw `("target", target_branch)` in Rust source → read `docs/hook.md` → confirmed hooks use
`{{ target }}` syntax → posted correct example.

</good>
</example>

For **behavioral claims** — "X happens when you run Y", "command Z works in scenario W" — reading
code is not sufficient. Code has conditional branches, early returns, and error paths that are easy
to miss when tracing mentally. Before asserting what a command does in a specific scenario, either
find a test that exercises that exact scenario or run the command yourself. If neither is feasible,
hedge: "Based on code reading, I believe X, but I haven't verified this end-to-end."

<example>
<bad reason="Traced one code path but missed a guard clause in a called function">

Bad: Read `CommandEnv::for_action("commit", config)` → saw it constructs an env → concluded
`wt step commit` works in a detached worktree. Missed that `for_action()` calls
`require_current_branch()`, which errors on detached HEAD.

</bad>
<good reason="Built and tested the actual behavior before claiming">

Good: Read `for_action()` → noticed it calls `require_current_branch()` → uncertain whether
detached HEAD hits that path → ran `cargo build && wt step commit` in a detached worktree →
confirmed the error → posted accurate answer.

</good>
</example>

When a project has user-facing documentation (a docs site, `--help` pages, a wiki), link to it. A
link to the relevant docs page is more useful than a paraphrased explanation — and finding the link
forces verifying the claim.

If you can't find source evidence for a specific detail, say so ("I'm not sure of the exact
syntax") rather than guessing. An honest gap is fixable; a confident hallucination gets
copy-pasted.

### Rewriting is authoring

Cross-posting, summarizing, or paraphrasing is not copying — any new content you add requires the
same source verification as a fresh comment. If you expand with a config section header, code
block, or usage example, verify each addition against the source.

<example>
<bad reason="Composed new TOML section header without verifying it">

Bad: Cross-posted a hook snippet, added an alias example with `[step]` as the section header
(inferred from the `wt step` command name). The actual config section is `[aliases]`.

</bad>
<good reason="Verified new content against docs before posting">

Good: Cross-posted a hook snippet, added an alias example → checked `dev/*.example.toml` to
confirm the section is `[aliases]` → posted with correct syntax.

</good>
</example>

## Tone

Raise observations, don't assign work. Never create checklists or task lists for the PR author.

## PR Review Comments

For review comments on specific lines (`[Comment on path:line]`), read that file and examine the
code at that line before answering.

When the GitHub API returns a `diff_hunk`, the reviewer's comment targets the **last line** of that
hunk. Use this to disambiguate when multiple candidates exist nearby — match the reviewer's request
against the specific anchored line, not the surrounding region.
