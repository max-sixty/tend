# Weekly Maintenance

## Step 0: Load environment skills

Load `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci` first — it contains CI security rules, review/comment formatting, and polling conventions. This skill posts approvals and comments on PRs, so those rules apply. `running-in-ci` will also load the repo's `running-tend` overlay if one exists; keep the loaded content in mind for Step 3.

## Step 1: Find dependency PRs

```bash
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author,labels \
  --jq '.[] | select(.author.login == "dependabot[bot]" or .author.login == "renovate[bot]" or (.labels | any(.name == "dependencies")))'
```

If no dependency PRs are open, note "0 dependency PRs to process" and continue to Step 3 — do not exit; repo-specific weekly tasks may still be due.

## Step 2: For each dependency PR

1. Check CI status: `gh pr checks <number>`
2. If CI is passing, review the diff for breaking changes (major version bumps, API changes, deprecation warnings)
3. If the update is safe (patch/minor with green CI), check whether the bot has already approved this commit before approving — a dependabot PR open across multiple weekly runs (or already approved by `tend-review` on creation) would otherwise accumulate redundant approvals on the same `commit_id`:
   ```bash
   HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view <number> --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid')
   BOT_LOGIN=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
   LAST_APPROVAL_SHA=$(gh pr view <number> --json reviews \
     --jq "[.reviews[] | select(.author.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\" and .state == \"APPROVED\")] | last | .commit.oid // empty")

   if [ "$LAST_APPROVAL_SHA" = "$HEAD_SHA" ]; then
     echo "Already approved on this commit; skipping."
   else
     gh pr review <number> --approve --body "Automated dependency update — CI passing, no breaking changes."
   fi
   ```
4. If CI is failing, comment with the failure summary and skip
5. If a major version bump, comment noting it needs manual review and skip

## Step 3: Repo-specific weekly tasks

Scan the loaded `running-tend` skill for sections describing weekly maintenance — typical headings include "Weekly Maintenance", "Weekly:", or task names like "MSRV bump", "toolchain update", "cache audit", "README refresh". For each such task, perform it as the repo describes and follow the repo's PR title conventions when opening a PR.

If `running-tend` defines no weekly tasks (or none are due this week), say so in the summary.

## Step 4: Summary

Report: dependency PRs processed/approved/skipped (with reasons), and repo-specific weekly tasks completed (or "no repo-specific weekly tasks defined" / "no weekly tasks due").
