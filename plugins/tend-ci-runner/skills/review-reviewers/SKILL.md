# Review Reviewers

Analyze Claude-powered CI runs from the past hour. Identify behavioral problems, skill gaps, and
workflow issues — then create PRs or issues to fix them.

## Target repo

**Target repo:** $ARGUMENTS

Analysis targets an adopter repo whose CI runs are analyzed. Findings result in PRs/issues on the
current repo (tend) to improve skills and workflows.

Use `-R $ARGUMENTS` for commands that access the target repo (downloading artifacts, querying runs
and PRs). Commands without `-R` default to tend.

@review-gates.md

Use `TRACKING_LABEL="review-reviewers-tracking"` for this skill's tracking issues. Use
`-R $ARGUMENTS` when downloading session logs for historical evidence verification.

## Step 1: Find recent runs

List recently completed Claude CI runs on the target repo:

```bash
TARGET_REPO=$ARGUMENTS ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/list-recent-runs.sh
```

The script discovers `tend-*` workflows by default. Pass additional prefixes as arguments to
include other workflows (e.g., `review-reviewers` when analyzing tend itself).

If empty, report "no runs to review" and exit.

## Step 2: Download and analyze session logs

Load `/install-tend:debug-ci-session` for download commands and JSONL parsing queries. Use
`-R $ARGUMENTS` for all `gh` commands targeting the adopter repo.

Skip runs without artifacts. Trace decision chains: what did Claude decide, what evidence did it
use, what was the outcome?

## Step 3: Cross-check review sessions

For `tend-review` runs, compare what the bot said against what happened next:

```bash
HEAD_BRANCH=$(gh -R $ARGUMENTS run view <run-id> --json headBranch --jq '.headBranch')
PR_NUMBER=$(gh -R $ARGUMENTS pr list --head "$HEAD_BRANCH" --state all --json number --jq '.[0].number')
```

Check for subsequent commits that undid something the bot approved (gap in review), and human
review comments flagging issues the bot missed. Pull in the full PR context — not just changes
from the past hour.

CI polling time is expected and acceptable — do not flag it.

When the bot took an action that looks like it violated tend's default rules (e.g., closing an
issue), check the target repo's repo-specific guidance (`running-tend` skill or equivalent) before
flagging it. If the repo-specific guidance explicitly authorized the action, the bot behaved
correctly — do not flag it as a problem.

## Step 4: Deduplicate

Before creating issues or PRs, check exhaustively for existing ones:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --label claude-behavior --json number,title,body
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body  # also check unlabeled issues
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,body
gh issue list --state closed --label claude-behavior --json number,title,closedAt --limit 30
```

Search titles AND bodies for related keywords. Only comment on existing issues if you have
material new cases that would change the approach or increase prioritization. Do not comment with
progress updates, fix-PR status, or re-statements of evidence already in the issue.

## Step 5: Act on findings

**Prefer PRs over issues.** A PR with a clear description is immediately actionable.

- **PR** (default): Branch `hourly/review-$GITHUB_RUN_ID`, fix, commit, push, create with label
  `claude-behavior`. Put full analysis in PR description (run ID, log excerpts, root cause, **gate
  assessment** including historical evidence count). Don't also create a separate issue.
- **Issue** (fallback): Only for problems too large or ambiguous to fix directly. Include run ID,
  log excerpts, root cause analysis.

Group multiple findings by broad theme. **Limit to at most 2 PRs per run** — if you have more
findings, pick the highest-confidence ones and note the rest in the tracking issue.

## Step 6: Summary

If no problems found (or none passed the gates), report "all clear" with: runs analyzed, sessions
reviewed, brief quality assessment, and any below-threshold findings recorded in the tracking
issue.
