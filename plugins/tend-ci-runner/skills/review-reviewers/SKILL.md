# Review Reviewers

Analyze tend's CI behavior on the target repo over the past hour. Focus on **outcomes** — what the bot produced publicly and whether it was accepted — rather than internal session mechanics. Create PRs or issues on tend when outcomes reveal behavioral problems.

## First steps

Load `/tend-ci-runner:running-in-ci` first — it contains CI security rules, PR/comment formatting (line wrapping, heredoc hazards), and polling conventions. This skill opens PRs and issue comments on tend, so those rules apply.

## Cost discipline: cheap subagents for exploration

Session log parsing and outcome checking are token-heavy. Delegate all broad exploration to a **cheap subagent** (e.g. Haiku / gpt-mini). Keep the main agent for judgment: evaluating findings against gates, deciding whether to act, and drafting PRs.

Pattern:
1. Main agent sets up context (bot identity, repo guidance, run list)
2. Main agent spawns cheap subagent to survey outcomes across all runs → receives structured summary
3. Main agent evaluates the summary against gates
4. If needed, main agent spawns another cheap subagent to investigate specific session logs → receives diagnosis
5. Main agent drafts fix PR if warranted

## Core principle: outcomes over internals

The bot's job is to produce useful outputs: reviews, triage comments, fix commits, issue responses. The cheapest way to evaluate quality is to check whether those outputs were **accepted** (merged, kept, acted on) or **rejected** (reverted, closed, corrected, disagreed with).

Session logs are expensive to download and parse. Only escalate to session-log inspection when outcome signals indicate a real problem worth diagnosing.

## Core principle: repo-specific guidance is primary

Each adopter repo has its own guidance (`running-tend` skill or equivalent) that shapes how the bot should behave in that repo. This repo-specific guidance **takes precedence** over tend's default rules. The bot's job is to follow the repo-specific guidance first, falling back to tend's defaults only where the repo doesn't specify.

## Non-issues: do not flag these

Some patterns look suspicious but are intentional. Before drafting a finding, check this list — flagging expected behaviors creates maintainer churn and costs trust.

- **`tend-review` re-approving after the bot pushed a fix commit.** The reviewer role is independent of commit and PR authorship. Re-reviewing (and re-approving) after `tend-notifications`, `tend-ci-fix`, or a mention run pushes a fix is expected behavior, not a re-approval loop. Authorship-keyed guards (skipping re-review when the bot pushed) are not the accepted shape — do not propose them. If you observe stacked approvals from concurrent runs that raced with concurrency-group cancellation, that is a *concurrency* issue (the cancelled runs managed to POST before the SIGTERM arrived), not a review-rule problem.

- **`tend-review` exiting silent on a genuinely self-authored PR with no concerns.** The bundled `review` skill explicitly authorizes "stay silent and skip to step 6" on self-authored PRs (`PR_AUTHOR == BOT_LOGIN`) without findings ([`review/SKILL.md`](https://github.com/max-sixty/tend/blob/main/plugins/tend-ci-runner/skills/review/SKILL.md), "Self-authored PRs") — GitHub rejects self-approvals, so APPROVE isn't an option. Treat silent first-reviews on bot-authored PRs as expected behavior, not "silent omission" or "divergence". Before citing an "APPROVE-on-bot-authored-PR pattern" as a counter-precedent, verify each cited PR's literal author with `gh pr view <n> --json author --jq '.author.login'`: owner-authored PRs (e.g. `max-sixty`) are reviewed and approved normally and are not a "bot-authored APPROVE" precedent.

- **`tend-mention` firing on the bot's own comments and exiting silently.** When the bot comments on an issue or PR where it has previously participated (including its own tracking issues such as `review-reviewers-tracking` and `review-runs-tracking`), the `issue_comment` event fires `tend-mention`; the prompt's self-conversation guard then detects the self-trigger and exits silently after a few Claude turns. This looks wasteful (each exit costs ~$0.20–$0.50), but sender-based or commenter-based filters on `tend-mention` are not the accepted shape — they are the same authorship-keyed-guard pattern rejected for `tend-review`. The accepted shape for loop-prevention is a label-based skip (e.g. skipping `tend-outage`-labeled issues); propose new filters only when there's a distinct loop risk that can't be expressed with a label.

- **`tend-notifications` mark-reading a cross-repo `CheckSuite` `ci_activity` notification from an abandoned fork and exiting silently.** A fork that doesn't sync upstream keeps running its own scheduled `tend-*` workflows; when those fail, the canonical bot receives `reason: ci_activity` `CheckSuite` notifications about another repo's CI. The notifications skill classifies them as cross-repo not-actionable and marks them read, but the agent still spins up. The accepted shape is the workflow-level `github.repository_owner` fork-owner guard, which causes synced forks to no-op on the cron; the residual cost of abandoned-fork notifications is small enough not to justify a permanent pre-check layer. Do not propose a pre-check filter keyed on `reason`, `subject_type`, or sender, and do not maintain a per-month occurrence threshold for this notification shape — record as carry observations and move on.

## Target repo

**Target repo:** $ARGUMENTS

Analysis targets an adopter repo whose CI runs are analyzed. Findings result in PRs/issues on the current repo (tend) to improve skills and workflows.

Use `-R $ARGUMENTS` for commands that access the target repo (querying runs, PRs, issues). Commands without `-R` default to tend.

@review-gates.md

## Evidence accumulation

Each run only sees a window of CI sessions, but patterns emerge over days or weeks. Evidence for this skill lives in **secret gists owned by the bot** — one per `(target repo, month)` pair. A monthly tracking issue on tend labeled `review-reviewers-tracking` lists the gists via bot comments, so maintainers can discover them.

Secret gists are URL-unlisted but readable by anyone with the URL; they are at least as private as the current public tracking issues, and give a single structured file that accumulates per-target findings without hitting the 65 KB comment limit.

### Setup

```bash
MONTH=$(date +%Y-%m)
TRACKING_LABEL="review-reviewers-tracking"
TARGET="$ARGUMENTS"
GIST_DESC="review-reviewers evidence: $TARGET $MONTH"
```

### Finding or creating the tracking issue

The tracking issue lives on tend (the current repo). It indexes gists via one comment per new gist — no per-run comments, no body edits.

The matrix runs three targets concurrently on the same cron tick, so the first run of a new month races: all three targets can find no tracking issue and each create one. Sorting and picking the lowest-numbered match keeps later runs deterministic — maintainers can close any duplicates. `gh issue create` prints the new issue's URL; parse the number from its basename.

```bash
TRACKING_NUMBER=$(gh issue list --state open --label "$TRACKING_LABEL" \
  --json number,title --jq ".[] | select(.title | contains(\"$MONTH\")) | .number" \
  | sort -n | head -1)

if [ -z "$TRACKING_NUMBER" ]; then
  cat > /tmp/tracking-body.md << 'EOF'
Monthly tracking issue for `review-reviewers`. Per-target evidence lives in secret gists owned by the bot. A comment below is posted when each target's gist is first created.

**Do not close manually** — a new issue is created each month.
EOF
  TRACKING_URL=$(gh issue create \
    --title "$TRACKING_LABEL: $MONTH" \
    --label "$TRACKING_LABEL" \
    -F /tmp/tracking-body.md)
  if [ -z "$TRACKING_URL" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: gh issue create failed" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  TRACKING_NUMBER=$(basename "$TRACKING_URL")
fi
```

### Finding or creating the evidence gist

Search the bot's own gists by description. Descriptions are our stable key — GitHub does not let us pick gist IDs.

```bash
GIST_ID=$(gh api /gists --paginate \
  --jq ".[] | select(.description == \"$GIST_DESC\") | .id" | head -1)

if [ -z "$GIST_ID" ]; then
  # The gist file takes its name from the local file's basename; later reads
  # and PATCHes target `findings.md`, so the seed must live at that basename.
  mkdir -p /tmp/gist-seed
  # Use the Write tool to author /tmp/gist-seed/findings.md (substituting
  # $TARGET and $MONTH from the environment). Content:
  #
  #   # review-reviewers evidence — <target> — <YYYY-MM>
  #
  #   Secret gist. Append-only log of below-threshold findings used for gate evaluation.
  GIST_URL=$(gh gist create --desc "$GIST_DESC" /tmp/gist-seed/findings.md)
  if [ -z "$GIST_URL" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: gh gist create failed — TEND_BOT_TOKEN likely lacks 'gist' scope (see install-tend)" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  GIST_ID=$(basename "$GIST_URL")
  # First time this month for this target — announce the gist on the tracking issue
  gh issue comment "$TRACKING_NUMBER" \
    --body "Evidence gist for \`$TARGET\`: $GIST_URL"
else
  GIST_URL="https://gist.github.com/$GIST_ID"
fi
```

The TEND_BOT_TOKEN needs `gist` scope (see install-tend). Without it, `gh gist create` fails with `403 Forbidden` and the skill exits before posting a broken tracking-issue comment.

### Reading historical evidence

Before applying the gates, read the current month's gist for this target. Pass `--raw` so `gh` emits the file content verbatim instead of a TTY-rendered form. The recording step below appends to this same file, so fetch once:

```bash
gh gist view "$GIST_ID" -f findings.md --raw > /tmp/current.md
```

Also check last month's gist for recent carry-over. Compute last month by subtracting a day from the first of the current month — `date -d 'last month'` on the 31st can return the current month on GNU date, silently skipping the prior month's evidence:

```bash
FIRST=$(date -u +%Y-%m-01)
LAST_MONTH=$(date -u -d "$FIRST -1 day" +%Y-%m 2>/dev/null || date -u -v-1d -jf %Y-%m-%d "$FIRST" +%Y-%m)
LAST_DESC="review-reviewers evidence: $TARGET $LAST_MONTH"
LAST_GIST_ID=$(gh api /gists --paginate \
  --jq ".[] | select(.description == \"$LAST_DESC\") | .id" | head -1)
[ -n "$LAST_GIST_ID" ] && gh gist view "$LAST_GIST_ID" -f findings.md --raw > /tmp/last-month-findings.md
```

### Recording below-threshold findings

**Append a `## Run <RUN_ID>` heading every run**, even when no problem finding exceeded a gate threshold. For all-clear hours, record a single Low-evidence "all-clear" entry as the body — runs analyzed, outcomes checked, no concerning signals. The heading per run is the audit trail that prior runs read to count cumulative occurrences and confirm which hours were analyzed; missing entries leave gaps that erode gate evaluation across runs.

After applying the gates, write each run's new findings (format in `@review-gates.md`) to `/tmp/findings.md`, then append them to the gist's `findings.md`. Reuse the current content already fetched into `/tmp/current.md` in "Reading historical evidence", concatenate, and PATCH via the API (`--rawfile` preserves trailing newlines that command substitution would strip):

```bash
# Verify the run heading references this run's $GITHUB_RUN_ID literally —
# fabricated round numbers produce dead Workflow links, see @review-gates.md.
grep -qF "$GITHUB_RUN_ID" /tmp/findings.md || {
  echo "ERROR: /tmp/findings.md does not contain \$GITHUB_RUN_ID=$GITHUB_RUN_ID — refusing to PATCH gist" >&2
  exit 1
}
cat /tmp/current.md /tmp/findings.md > /tmp/combined.md
jq -n --rawfile content /tmp/combined.md \
  '{files: {"findings.md": {content: $content}}}' \
  | gh api "/gists/$GIST_ID" -X PATCH --input -
```

Never replace wholesale — prior entries contain per-run evidence needed for gate evaluation. See `@review-gates.md` for the per-finding format.

## Step 1: Setup

Resolve the **target repo's** bot login and load repo-specific guidance upfront — both are needed throughout. `gh api user` returns the *analysis* bot (e.g., `tend-agent` when review-reviewers runs on tend), which is typically **not** the target repo's bot — filtering reviews/comments by the wrong login produces false "no bot output" negatives. Read `bot_name` from the target repo's `.config/tend.yaml`:

```bash
BOT_LOGIN=$(gh api "repos/$ARGUMENTS/contents/.config/tend.yaml" --jq '.content' 2>/dev/null \
  | base64 -d 2>/dev/null \
  | yq '.bot_name // ""' 2>/dev/null)
if [ -z "$BOT_LOGIN" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: could not resolve bot_name from $ARGUMENTS/.config/tend.yaml" >&2
  exit 1
fi
echo "BOT_LOGIN=$BOT_LOGIN (target: $ARGUMENTS)"
```

Read the target repo's repo-specific guidance to understand what the bot was told to do:

```bash
gh api "repos/$ARGUMENTS/contents/.claude/skills/running-tend/SKILL.md" \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d
```

If the file doesn't exist, try common alternatives (`.claude/skills/running-tend.md`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`). Understanding the repo's guidance is essential context for evaluating outcomes — without it, you'll misjudge authorized behavior as a violation.

Then list recently completed tend CI runs on the target repo:

```bash
TARGET_REPO=$ARGUMENTS ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/list-recent-runs.sh
```

The script discovers `tend-*` workflows by default. Pass additional prefixes as arguments to include other workflows (e.g., `review-reviewers` when analyzing tend itself).

If empty, report "no runs to review" and exit.

## Step 2: Survey outcomes via cheap subagent

Spawn a cheap subagent to check outcomes across all runs from Step 1. The subagent does the token-heavy work of mapping runs to PRs/issues and checking acceptance signals.

Use a cheap subagent (e.g. Haiku / gpt-mini) and a prompt like:

> Survey bot outcomes on `$ARGUMENTS` for the following runs: [run IDs from Step 1].
> The bot's login is `$BOT_LOGIN`.
>
> For each run, determine:
> 1. Did the bot produce visible output (review, comment, issue action, commit)?
> 2. If yes, was the output accepted or rejected?
>
> **How to map runs to outputs:**
> - `tend-review`: `gh -R $ARGUMENTS run view <run-id> --json headBranch` → find PR via
>   `gh -R $ARGUMENTS pr list --head <branch> --state all` → check bot reviews via
>   `gh api repos/$ARGUMENTS/pulls/<pr>/reviews`
> - `tend-notifications`: check for recent bot comments/issue-close events in the past hour
> - `tend-mention`: map run to issue/PR from triggering comment, check for bot replies
> - `tend-ci-fix`: map run → PR via `headBranch`, check for bot commits
>
> **Negative outcome signals** (report these):
> - Human reviewer posted CHANGES_REQUESTED after bot approved
> - PR closed without merge shortly after bot approved
> - Bot posted no review despite a `tend-review` run completing on an open PR
> - Subsequent commits reversed changes the bot approved
> - Bot-closed issue was reopened
> - Fix commit was reverted or CI still failing after bot pushed
> - Human replied to bot with correction or complaint
> - Bot comment contains corruption (literal `${`, unescaped bangs, backslash-backticks, broken heredoc markers)
>
> **Corruption-scan recipe.** Save bot bodies to a file, then scan with `grep`:
>
> ```bash
> mkdir -p /tmp/bot-output && : > /tmp/bot-output/all.txt
> # Issue/PR comments (issue_comment endpoint)
> for n in <pr-or-issue-numbers>; do
>   gh api "repos/$ARGUMENTS/issues/$n/comments?per_page=100" \
>     --jq ".[] | select(.user.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\" and .created_at > \"<window-start>\") | \"=== #$n issue-comment \(.id) ===\n\(.body)\n\"" \
>     >> /tmp/bot-output/all.txt
> done
> # Issue bodies (when bot opened the issue this window)
> for n in <bot-opened-issues>; do
>   gh api "repos/$ARGUMENTS/issues/$n" \
>     --jq "select(.user.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\" and .created_at > \"<window-start>\") | \"=== ISSUE #$n body ===\n\(.body)\n\"" \
>     >> /tmp/bot-output/all.txt
> done
> # PR bodies (only when bot opened the PR this window)
> for n in <bot-opened-prs>; do
>   gh api "repos/$ARGUMENTS/pulls/$n" \
>     --jq "select(.user.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\" and .created_at > \"<window-start>\") | \"=== PR #$n body ===\n\(.body)\n\"" \
>     >> /tmp/bot-output/all.txt
> done
> # PR reviews + inline review comments — any PR the bot reviewed/commented on, not just
> # bot-opened. tend-review's output ships on human-authored PRs (the most common surface)
> # which would never appear in <bot-opened-prs>.
> for n in <pr-numbers-bot-reviewed>; do
>   gh api "repos/$ARGUMENTS/pulls/$n/reviews" \
>     --jq ".[] | select(.user.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\" and .submitted_at > \"<window-start>\") | \"=== PR #$n review \(.id) state=\(.state) ===\n\(.body)\n\"" \
>     >> /tmp/bot-output/all.txt
>   gh api "repos/$ARGUMENTS/pulls/$n/comments?per_page=100" \
>     --jq ".[] | select(.user.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\" and .created_at > \"<window-start>\") | \"=== PR #$n inline-comment \(.id) ===\n\(.body)\n\"" \
>     >> /tmp/bot-output/all.txt
> done
> grep -nF '${' /tmp/bot-output/all.txt        # literal ${...} interpolation failure
> grep -nP '\\!' /tmp/bot-output/all.txt       # backslash-bang corruption
> grep -nP '\\`' /tmp/bot-output/all.txt       # backslash-backtick corruption
> grep -nE 'blob/main/.*#L[0-9]' /tmp/bot-output/all.txt  # un-pinned line links
> grep -nF 'anthropics/' /tmp/bot-output/all.txt         # wrong-owner URL
> ```
>
> Cover all four bot-output surfaces: issue comments, issue bodies, PR bodies, and reviews/inline review comments. Comments-only scans miss corruption that ships in a survey-issue or PR body.
>
> **Report format** — return a structured summary:
> ```
> ## Runs with no bot output (skipped)
> - <run-id>: <workflow> — <reason> (e.g., "no artifacts", "notification no-op")
>
> ## Runs with accepted output
> - <run-id>: <workflow> on PR #N — bot reviewed, PR merged
>
> ## Runs with concerning output
> - <run-id>: <workflow> on PR #N — <signal> (e.g., "human posted CHANGES_REQUESTED")
>
> ## Sanity check
> <note if zero bot activity found across all runs — may indicate systemic failure>
> ```

Review the subagent's summary. If all outputs are accepted and no sanity-check flags, skip to Step 6 (summary). If concerning outcomes exist, continue to Step 3.

## Step 3: Investigate concerning outcomes via cheap subagent

For runs with negative outcome signals (or suspicious lack of output), spawn another cheap subagent to download and inspect the specific session logs.

Use a cheap subagent (e.g. Haiku / gpt-mini) and a prompt like:

> Investigate session logs for run <run-id> on `$ARGUMENTS`.
>
> Download: `gh run download <run-id> -R $ARGUMENTS --pattern 'claude-session-logs*' --dir /tmp/session-logs/<run-id>/`
>
> The concerning outcome was: <signal from Step 2>.
>
> **JSONL parsing** — each line has a `type` field (`user`, `assistant`, `system`). Key queries:
> ```
> # Tool calls in order
> jq -r 'select(.type == "assistant") | .message.content[]? | select(.type == "tool_use") | "\(.name): \(.input | tostring | .[0:120])"' FILE
> # Assistant reasoning
> jq -r 'select(.type == "assistant") | .message.content[]? | select(.type == "text") | .text' FILE
> # Bash commands executed
> jq -r 'select(.type == "assistant") | .message.content[]? | select(.type == "tool_use" and .name == "Bash") | .input.command' FILE
> ```
>
> Focus narrowly: what decision did the bot make that led to this bad outcome? Trace the decision
> chain in the JSONL for the specific problematic action. Don't parse the entire session.
> CI polling (sleep loops checking `gh pr checks`) in session logs is expected bot behavior — do
> not flag it.
>
> Report: what the bot decided, what evidence it used, and what went wrong.

Evaluate the subagent's diagnosis against the repo-specific guidance from Step 1. Determine whether the failure is structural (same conditions always produce this failure) or stochastic (probabilistic model behavior that might not recur).

## Step 4: Deduplicate

Before creating issues or PRs, check exhaustively for existing ones:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --label claude-behavior --json number,title,body
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body  # also check unlabeled issues
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,headRefName,body
gh issue list --state closed --label claude-behavior --json number,title,closedAt --limit 30
```

Search titles AND bodies for related keywords. Only comment on existing issues if you have material new cases that would change the approach or increase prioritization. Do not comment with progress updates, fix-PR status, or re-statements of evidence already in the issue.

## Step 5: Act on findings

**Prefer PRs over issues.** A PR with a clear description is immediately actionable.

- **PR** (default): Branch `hourly/review-$GITHUB_RUN_ID`, fix, commit, push, create with label `claude-behavior`. Put full analysis in PR description (run ID, outcome evidence, root cause, **gate assessment** including historical evidence count). Don't also create a separate issue.
- **Issue** (fallback): Only for problems too large or ambiguous to fix directly. Include run ID, outcome evidence, root cause analysis.

Group multiple findings by broad theme. **Limit to at most 2 PRs per run** — if you have more findings, pick the highest-confidence ones and record the rest in the evidence gist.

PR/issue bodies should link to the evidence gist (`$GIST_URL`) so reviewers can see the accumulated history behind the finding.

**Do not poll CI** after creating a PR. The `tend-review` and `tend-ci-fix` workflows handle PRs independently. Exit after pushing and creating the PR.

## Step 6: Summary

Report results in the conversation log and save a markdown summary to `/tmp/claude/step-summary.md` (a post-Claude step copies this into the GitHub Actions step summary). Use the Write tool. Include `$GIST_URL` at the top so maintainers viewing the run page can click through to the full evidence log:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/claude
# Then use the Write tool to author /tmp/claude/step-summary.md, starting:
#
#   ## Review-reviewers summary
#
#   Evidence: <value of $GIST_URL>
#
#   ...
```

If no problems found (or none passed the gates), report "all clear" with: runs analyzed, outcomes checked, brief quality assessment, and a link to the evidence gist for any below-threshold findings recorded this run.
