"""Obtain a long-lived Claude Code OAuth token via `claude setup-token`.

Prints the token to stdout and everything else to stderr, so stdout pipes
straight into a consumer without the rest of the run coming with it.

`claude setup-token` renders its TUI with Ink, which draws only when stdout
is a TTY, so the child needs a pty. It then completes one of two ways. Normally
the CLI's own localhost listener takes the redirect and the run finishes with
no input at all — approving in the browser is the whole of the user's job.
Failing that, the browser lands on a page showing a `code#state` string and the
TUI waits at its paste prompt. Both paths have to stay open, which is why this
drives the pty itself rather than through script(1) — script(1) reads terminal
attributes from its own stdin and aborts with "tcgetattr: Operation not
supported on socket" when that is anything but a tty or /dev/null, and a
/dev/null stdin leaves the paste prompt unanswerable.

The authorize URL goes to stderr as soon as the TUI offers it, so a caller
running this in the background can hand it to the user. So does the TUI's own
error line, which is the difference between a run that is waiting for a person
and one that has already failed — indistinguishable from outside otherwise,
since a rejected code leaves the TUI sitting at "Press Enter to retry" for the
rest of the window. Nothing else from the TUI is echoed: its output carries the
token.

Usage:
    oauth_token.py [--code-file PATH]

`--code-file` names a path to watch. Write the `code#state` string there and it
is typed into the TUI, for the runs where the browser shows a code instead of
returning to the CLI. Most runs never need it.
