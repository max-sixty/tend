# Development

Tend is an autonomous CI maintainer for GitHub repos: it reviews PRs, triages
issues, and fixes CI, powered by Claude or Codex. This repo ships the generator
(`uvx tend@latest`) that stamps each adopter's workflow files, plus the plugins
and composite actions those workflows run.

No backward compatibility. When a config format or API changes, cut over
completely — old formats should fail with a clear error, not silently parse.

Simplicity outranks efficiency. Complexity earns its place by preventing
wrong outward actions — what the bot posts, approves, merges, or closes —
never by saving compute. Wasted compute (a no-op session, a duplicated
survey, a slow CI job, a run lost to a blip that a later tick retries)
costs cents; the gate, retry wrapper, or scheduling arithmetic that would
have prevented it has to be understood and maintained forever. Fix waste
only when the fix is a simple knob — a cadence value, a deleted step, a
one-line condition — and otherwise leave it. Prefer deleting a mechanism
over refining it.

## Commands

```bash
wt test                                # everything: uv run pytest, then worker/'s vitest
uv run pytest                          # the Python half alone, from the repo root
uvx tend@latest init                   # regenerate workflows from .config/tend.yaml
uvx tend@latest init --dry-run         # preview without writing
uvx tend@latest check                  # verify branch protection, secrets, bot access
uv tool run pre-commit run --all-files # lint: every hook in .pre-commit-config.yaml
```

The repo root is a uv workspace, and pytest run from it collects every Python
test — generator/, proxy/, shared/steps/, and the install-tend scripts — so
one `pytest` is the whole Python run. `wt test` (defined in
[`.config/wt.toml`](.config/wt.toml)) adds worker/'s vitest suite and
typecheck. Its arguments narrow pytest and nothing else, so a filtered run
still pays for worker/; `uv run pytest -k render`
is the Python half on its own.

`pre-commit` is not on the CI sandbox's PATH, which is why the lint command
above carries the `uv tool run` prefix; a narrower substitute (ruff alone,
shellcheck alone) skips ten of the thirteen hooks, including the three
`repo: local` guards — the bang-backtick check, the install-tend mirror sync,
and the `sandbox_env` reserved-set parity check.

## Architecture

Four pieces:

1. **Plugins** — `install-tend` (user-facing setup) and `tend-ci-runner` (CI
   skills). Both ship from the same marketplace.
2. **Composite actions** — the stable interface, pinned to an immutable
   release tag (`max-sixty/tend/<action-path>@X.Y.Z`, the generator's own version
   — no floating `v1`). Every action lives under a harness-named path; there
   is no bare-root default. The two harness runners are:
   - `max-sixty/tend/claude@X.Y.Z` (Claude) — runs the official `claude`
     binary headless (`claude -p`) inside the shared Anthropic Sandbox Runtime
     boundary; completion is the process exit code plus result event.
     Inputs in `claude/action.yaml`.
   - `max-sixty/tend/codex@X.Y.Z` (Codex) — installs `@openai/codex` and
     shells out to `codex exec`. Skills are staged on disk and an
     `AGENTS.md` in `$CODEX_HOME` teaches Codex to resolve
     `/tend-ci-runner:NAME` slash commands. Inputs in `codex/action.yaml`.
     Shares the cross-harness workspace, SRT lifecycle, preflight, and teardown
     scripts under `shared/steps/`.

   Both harness runners resolve the bot's numeric ID at runtime, run security
   and rate-limit preflight, prepare an independent event checkout, run
   `sandbox_setup:` and the complete agent turn in one SRT process tree, reap
   it, and upload bounded session logs. The generated workflow's checkout stays
   runner-owned on reviewed code for setup and local-action POST chains.

   `max-sixty/tend/codex/refresh@X.Y.Z` is the Codex support action. A generated
   serialized workflow runs it weekly to rotate Plus/Pro credentials and
   publish the full and access-only bundles. It holds no bot token and does not
   inspect adopter code. Inputs in `codex/refresh/action.yaml`.

   Removed: `claude-interactive`, a PTY-supervised variant of the same binary
   that existed only to dodge the 2026-06-15 Agent SDK metering (which covered
   `claude -p` but not interactive sessions). Anthropic paused that change and
   the default harness now runs the binary rather than the SDK, so nothing
   selected it. Restore from `036f9c4` if the metering resumes.
3. **Generator** (`uvx tend@latest init`) — stamps workflow files into
   the adopter's `.github/workflows/` from `.config/tend.yaml`. Picks the
   right action ref and secret names per `harness`. Generation is
   idempotent — running `init` again overwrites all files from the
   current config. When the review workflow is generated, it also merges the
   `concurrency.queue` ignore into the adopter-owned
   `.github/actionlint.yaml` (see "Concurrency and filtering").
4. **Config** (`.config/tend.yaml`) — inputs to the generator. Overrides
   from defaults only. `harness: claude | codex` selects the harness
   (default `claude`). A per-workflow `harness:` override (and matching
   `model:`) lets an adopter trial a different harness on one workflow at a
   time. All workflows are generated by default. A per-workflow
   `enabled: false` omits that workflow on regeneration; top-level
   `enabled: false` leaves the workflows installed and pauses new jobs at
   runtime.

Generated workflows are standalone — full `steps:` jobs, not
`workflow_call`. The generator owns the entire file. Trusted runner setup
(system tools and Actions caches) is defined in `setup:`; dependency setup
against the event tree is defined in `sandbox_setup:` and runs inside SRT.

## Key details

The `tend-*.yaml` files in `.github/workflows/` are generated by `uvx tend@latest init`
from `.config/tend.yaml`. Edit the generator or config, not the workflow files
directly.

The generator is a Python package under `generator/` — uses the uv_build
backend, requires Python 3.11+. Runtime dependencies: click, jinja2,
ruamel.yaml. It is the one member of the repo's uv workspace, so the lockfile
and the dev dependencies (pytest, pytest-regtest, and the pinned mitmproxy the
proxy addon imports) live in the root `pyproject.toml`, and the dev environment
needs 3.12+ even though the package supports 3.11.

Consuming repos regenerate their `tend-*.yaml` workflows nightly (tend itself
included — it dogfoods its own workflows). Changes to the generator do not
require manual regeneration in downstream repos.

Tend's own `tend-*.yaml` workflows track the latest published release. They
update each night via `uvx tend@latest init`. Updating earlier to the latest
release (e.g., during a release commit) is fine. Never regenerate them with
the in-tree generator: the action ref is pinned to the generator's own
version (`max-sixty/tend/<harness>@X.Y.Z`), so an unreleased in-tree version
stamps a tag that does not exist yet, and the workflow's `uses:` fails to resolve.
Between a generator commit and the next release the committed workflows lag
the in-tree generator; that is expected, and the gap closes at the next
release (which tags `X.Y.Z` before regenerating, so the pin always resolves).

`claude_version` in `claude/action.yaml` is an exact version taken from npm's
`latest` dist-tag, not `stable`. `stable` lags several releases, and pinning it
wouldn't keep un-promoted code out of the job anyway: `install.sh` always
downloads the `latest` build as its bootstrap installer, and only the agent
session runs the pin.

## Generator vs adopter ownership

| Aspect | Owner | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger events (`on:`) | Generator | generated workflow |
| Filter conditions (`if:`) | Generator | generated workflow |
| Engagement verification (mention) | Generator | generated workflow |
| Concurrency groups | Generator | generated workflow |
| Permissions | Generator | generated workflow |
| Checkout | Generator | generated workflow |
| Composite action call | Generator | generated workflow |
| Runner setup (system tools, Actions cache) | Adopter | `setup:` in `.config/tend.yaml` |
| Event-tree setup (dependencies, generated files) | Adopter | `sandbox_setup:` in `.config/tend.yaml` |
| Bot identity, auth config | Adopter | `.config/tend.yaml` |
| Skills (generic) | Tend | `tend` plugin (marketplace) |
| Skills (project-specific) | Adopter | `.claude/skills/` in their repo |

## Workflow overrides

Adopters extend generated workflows via YAML keys that the generator
merges into the rendered YAML using RFC 7396 (JSON Merge Patch — mappings
deep-merge, scalars and lists replace, `null` deletes):

```yaml
workflows:
  review:
    workflow_extra:
      env:
        MY_VAR: hello
    jobs:
      review:
        timeout-minutes: 240
        runs-on: ubuntu-22.04-large
```

YAML has a native `null` literal, so RFC 7396's null-deletes works
directly — e.g. drop the cron from a scheduled workflow while keeping
`workflow_dispatch`:

```yaml
workflows:
  nightly:
    workflow_extra:
      on:
        schedule: null
```

Workflow-level (`workflow_extra`) and job-level (`jobs.<name>`) overrides
are supported; step-level is not — `setup:` handles trusted runner steps and
`sandbox_setup:` handles event-workspace commands. No allowlist of override
keys; unknown job names produce a warning.

When overrides are present, the generator renders the base template,
parses it, merges the overrides, and re-serializes. Output YAML formatting
differs slightly from the base template (block-style lists) but is
functionally identical.

## Auth

Each adopter creates a GitHub bot account and a classic PAT (`public_repo`
for public repos, `repo` for private) plus `workflow`, `notifications`,
`write:discussion`, `gist`, `user`. The PAT and a Claude OAuth token are
stored as secrets in the repo's `tend` GitHub Environment, whose deployment
branch policy admits only the branches `tend check` confirmed the bot
cannot write — the default branch and any `protected_branches` that exist
and are protected. A workflow the bot pushes to any other ref is refused
them before its first step. Two things use the `gist` scope, both
through bot-owned secret gists: `review-reviewers` keeps a per-month
structured evidence store (avoids the 65 KB comment-body limit), and the
experimental `memory_gist` setting persists Claude Code's auto memory
across runs. The `user` scope lets `install-tend` set the bot's profile
bio (`PATCH /user`) so the account's authorization stance is discoverable
on the bot's user page.

The agent may use PAT-backed GitHub API and git access for any repository the
bot account can reach; this cross-repository access is intentional. Credential
isolation keeps the PAT itself out of the agent process. If the PAT is stolen
by compromising the runner or proxy, its `public_repo` scope grants full write
to every public repository the bot can access. Fine-grained PATs allow
per-category scoping but don't support outside collaborators ([GitHub roadmap
#601](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/601), not shipped).

**Current privilege model: write + branch protection + environment gate.**
The bot has write access; a merge restriction (ruleset or branch
protection) is the primary security boundary — without it the bot can merge
its own PRs — and the `tend` environment keeps the operational secrets out
of any run the bot can cause on its own. `tend check` verifies both are
configured correctly, and `--fix` creates either. See
`docs/security-model.md` for the full threat model. Alternative models
(GitHub App, triage+fork) are in `TODO.md`.

Every adopter runs the environment gate: both secrets live in the `tend`
environment with no repo-level copies. This repo's own workflows name it
too, including the hand-maintained ones the generator never touches.

## Concurrency and filtering

Events pass through three layers before the bot does work:

1. **GHA `if:` conditions** — evaluated by Actions before the job starts.
   A false condition skips the job entirely (never enters the concurrency
   group, never queues).
2. **Custom `should_run` pre-checks** — cheap deterministic steps that decide
   whether the agent boots: mention's verify job checks engagement, and
   notifications' check repairs repository watching, captures a paginated
   cutoff snapshot, and finds configured-bot PR conflicts whose current heads
   have not already been deferred for manual resolution.
3. **Concurrency groups** — at most one running job per group.

Concurrency groups:

| Workflow | Group key | Cancel-in-progress |
|---|---|---|
| review | `workflow-PR#` | **no** — killing a session discards a review it can still deliver; `queue: max` holds pending PR events within GitHub's queue limit while it folds the push in and posts |
| mention/relay | none | stateless — secretless job that re-posts review events as a `repository_dispatch` |
| mention/verify | none | stateless |
| mention/handle | `workflow-handle-issue#\|PR#` | **no** — each mention runs to completion |
| triage | `workflow-issue#` | yes — latest comment wins |
| notifications | `tend-notifications` | **no** — one poll drains notifications and repairs bot PRs at a time |
| ci-fix | `workflow-<watched workflow>-<branch>` | **no** — a session mid-fix may already have pushed a branch or opened a PR |
| nightly / weekly | none | cron-serialized |
| codex-auth-refresh (codex only) | `tend-codex-auth-refresh` | **no** — only this workflow may rotate the refresh-token chain, so a second refresher must never race it |

**Fork guard.** Workflows whose triggers can fire from a fork's own
Actions (`schedule`, `workflow_dispatch`, `workflow_run`, `issues`) carry
`if: github.repository_owner == '<owner>'` so a fork that's enabled
Actions but doesn't have the bot/Claude secrets no-ops cleanly. The
canonical owner is detected at `init` time (via `gh repo view`, walking
`source.owner.login` if the local repo is itself a fork) and pinned in
the generated workflow. `tend-review` uses `pull_request_target` (base
repo only) and `tend-mention`'s review-event paths already filter forks
via `head.repo.full_name == github.repository`, so neither needs the
guard.

**Red branches.** A red default branch fails every push that follows it, each
on its own commit, so ci-fix keys its group on the branch — a commit-keyed
group collapses nothing, since the burst is distinct commits rather than one
commit retried. The watched workflow is in the key too, so a red
`publish-site` isn't starved behind a stream of red `ci`. ci-fix's group is
job-level, not workflow-level: most `workflow_run` events are green runs the
job's `if` skips, and a skipped job never enters the group.

**GHA queue depth.** Review sets `queue: max`, so pending PR events within
GitHub's queue limit wait and a later push cannot replace `ready_for_review`.
GitHub accepts the key; actionlint's schema does not, so `init` merges the
matching ignore into `.github/actionlint.yaml`, which the binary reads for
every invocation.
Mention/handle and notifications keep the default one-pending-run queue; when a
third job arrives while one runs and one queues, the pending job is replaced. For mention,
mitigation lives in the skill prompts: dedup if the bot already responded to
the triggering comment; self-heal earlier comments without a bot reply (oldest
first). The workflow injects the queue-to-run time delta (seconds between event
timestamp and job start) into the prompt — over ~40 s indicates the job was
queued behind another run, making conversation drift more likely.
Notifications stay unread until a poll records an outcome, so the newest
pending run covers a replaced poll. ci-fix keeps the default too, and wants
it: while a session works a red branch, the newest unsuccessful run carries
that branch's current state, so replacing the pending run loses nothing.

## Skill design: bundled for everyone, overlay for one

Bundled skills in `plugins/tend-ci-runner/skills/` supply defaults. Consumer
repos overlay them at `.claude/skills/running-tend/SKILL.md`; where the two
conflict, the overlay wins.

`.agents/skills` links to `.claude/skills`, so Claude and Codex discover the
same repo-local skills.

When writing a bundled skill, keep the content universal — it applies to
every consumer. Repo-specific policy, taste, or convention (PR title
formats, label names, branch routing) belongs in an overlay. Tend has its
own overlay at `.claude/skills/running-tend/SKILL.md` — use it for guidance
that only applies to developing tend itself.

Use outcomes from adopter runs to refine the skills. A general missing
instruction or wrong default belongs in the bundled skill; repository policy
belongs in that repository's overlay.

### Authoring skills

When adding to or editing files in `plugins/tend-ci-runner/skills/` or
`.claude/skills/`:

- **Be brief.** Skills are loaded into every relevant session — extra prose
  is overhead. Lead with the rule or recipe; cut motivation, anecdotes, and
  historical context unless required to apply the rule.
- **No specific past-run references.** Don't link GitHub Actions runs, cite
  session IDs, or quote durations from individual incidents. They age into
  trivia and aren't useful when the skill is reused. State the structural
  rule without the run links.
- **No specific past-case references.** Don't cite individual past PRs,
  issues, or commits as supporting precedent for a rule (e.g. "[#123] tried
  X and was closed"). They age into trivia, accumulate as the rule is
  re-tested, and create read-time work. State the structural rule (what
  shape is accepted, what shape is not) without naming the cases that
  produced it.
- **Date-stamp only when the value depends on time.** A baseline number
  expected to drift can be dated; a one-shot incident citation should not be.
- **Prefer recipe over narrative.** A code block plus a one-sentence framing
  beats a multi-paragraph explanation.
- **Examples over templates; open frames over closed menus.** For text the
  agent *produces* (comments, PR bodies, summaries), give an example labeled
  as such rather than verbatim wording to paste — canned phrasing reproduced
  literally reads awkwardly off-situation. For choices the agent *makes* (when
  to respond, which cases to check), frame the goal and give examples rather
  than a list it will read as exhaustive. Reserve mandatory exact wording for
  fragile mechanics: dedup keys, commands, API formats.

## Agent-driven vs deterministic steps

Tend's workflows invoke the agent through the harness-specific composite
action (`max-sixty/tend/claude@X.Y.Z` for Claude, `max-sixty/tend/codex@X.Y.Z`
for Codex). When adding new capability, split work along this line:

- **The agent drives diagnostics and remediation.** Once the action is
  running, put logic into the relevant skill (or a script the skill calls —
  see `plugins/tend-ci-runner/scripts/`). The agent handles edge cases,
  interprets output, and writes clearer messages than shell.
- **Actions gate whether the agent runs at all.** Agent invocations cost
  tokens; gating them in YAML is cheap. Pre-check steps that early-exit
  the job (e.g. `tend-notifications`'s notification and PR conflict check)
  save an entire agent run when there's nothing to do. A gate stays cheap
  only while it stays trivial: one pre-check against a frequent no-op (an
  empty inbox every cron tick) earns its place; a run of bespoke gates,
  each skipping one rare event shape, is machinery that costs more than
  the boots it saves.

Keep the actions' Bash as linear installation and plumbing, not a second
implementation layer. Do not add branches, retries, caches, or state for rare
event shapes or small runner-time savings; put substantial behavior in a skill
or tested Python.

Don't build deterministic YAML steps for work that happens *inside* an
agent run. Extend the skill instead.

## Live testing against real GitHub

For live experiments against real GitHub behavior (environments, branch
protection, workflow triggers, secret release), `tend-agent/tend-integration`
is a persistent public repo we own, admin via the `tend-agent` account
(`gh auth token --user tend-agent`). Its `main` is branch-protected with
`enforce_admins: false`, so the owner can push directly and reset in place.
The weekly integration test (`.claude/skills/running-tend/references/integration-test.md`)
also drives it, so clean up any probe artifacts (extra workflows, branches,
environments, dummy secrets) when done.

## Site and worker

`site/` is the Astro marketing site (tend-src.com); `worker/` is the
Cloudflare Worker that serves its two data streams from `data/consumers.json`.

The site's dev server starts automatically per worktree via a `wt` post-start
hook (`.config/wt.toml`) on a deterministic port derived from the branch name.
Get the URL with `wt list statusline --format json | jq -r '.[].url'`; logs
land in `.git/wt/logs/`. Don't run `npm run dev`; it duplicates the running
server on a different port.
