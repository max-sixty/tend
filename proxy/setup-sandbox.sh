# Runner-side setup for credential isolation.
#
# Runs as the privileged `runner` user. Stands up everything needed to run the
# agent as a separate, non-sudo `tend-sandbox` user whose only path to an
# authenticated GitHub *or* Anthropic call is a local mitmproxy that holds the
# real secrets:
#
#   1. Create the tend-sandbox user (no sudo, distinct UID).
#   2. Neutralize the bot PAT actions/checkout persists for git — otherwise the
#      sandbox reads it off disk and isolation is moot.
#   3. Hand the checkout to tend-sandbox (and make the path traversable) so the
#      agent can edit and commit.
#   4. Start the injecting proxy (holds the real GitHub + Anthropic credentials
#      in its own memory) and system-trust its CA so the sandbox's gh/git accept
#      the intercepted TLS. (claude is Node and uses its own CA bundle, so the
#      agent step also points NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS at the exported PROXY_CA_CERT.)
#
# Exports for later steps via $GITHUB_ENV: SANDBOX, AGENT_HOME, PROXY_URL,
# TEND_RUN_DIR, PROXY_CA_CERT, AGENT_ENV_FILE.
#
# Inputs (env): TEND_GH_TOKEN (real PAT), TEND_ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN and/or
# TEND_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (real Anthropic credential, injected for
# api.anthropic.com), ACTION_PATH (this action's checkout), MITMPROXY_VERSION
# (pinned mitmproxy version). GITHUB_WORKSPACE / RUNNER_TEMP / UV_CACHE_DIR come
# from Actions. Optional adopter levers (from .config/tend.yaml): TEND_SANDBOX_PATH
# (newline-separated dirs prepended to the sandbox PATH) and TEND_SANDBOX_ENV
# (newline-separated NAME=VALUE pairs added to the agent env; reserved keys
# rejected). TEND_SANDBOX_SETUP (commands) is consumed by the separate
# shared/steps/sandbox-setup.sh step, not here.

# the auth headers for whichever scheme is set). The `tendproxydummy` marker
# lets the smoke prove the real secrets never reach the agent.
# CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE suppresses interactive prompts (auth confirmation,
# plugin-install confirmation) in every sandbox claude invocation.
# The XDG base dirs are pinned under the sandbox home: GitHub runners export
# XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/runner/.config (and may set the siblings), which leaks
