# Runs as the privileged `runner` user. Stands up everything needed to run the
# agent as a separate, non-sudo `tend-sandbox` user whose only path to an
# authenticated GitHub *or* Anthropic call is a local mitmproxy that holds the
# real secrets:
#
#   1. Create the tend-sandbox user (no sudo, distinct UID).
#   2. Neutralize the bot PAT actions/checkout persists for git — otherwise the
#      sandbox reads it off disk and isolation is moot.
#   3. Hand the checkout to tend-sandbox (and make the path traversable) so the
#      agent can edit and commit.
#   4. Start the injecting proxy (holds the real GitHub + Anthropic credentials
#      in its own memory) and system-trust its CA so the sandbox's gh/git accept
#      the intercepted TLS. (claude is Node and uses its own CA bundle, so the
#      agent step also points NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS at the exported PROXY_CA_CERT.)
#
# Exports for later steps via $GITHUB_ENV: SANDBOX, AGENT_HOME, PROXY_URL,

# TEND_BLOCKED_PATH.

# Inputs (env): TEND_GH_TOKEN (real PAT), TEND_ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN and/or
# TEND_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (real Anthropic credential, injected for

# (pinned mitmproxy version), TEND_UV_DIR (tend's own pinned uv, installed by
# shared/steps/install-uv.sh). GITHUB_WORKSPACE / RUNNER_TEMP /
# UV_CACHE_DIR come from Actions. TEND_RUNNER_TOOL_PATH carries the runner PATH
# as data while this process resolves commands from fixed system directories.
