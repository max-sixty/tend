"""Tests for plugins/tend-ci-runner/scripts/token-report.sh.

The report exists to answer "what did the spend go to?", so what is pinned
here is the grouping and the ranking: subjects come off the record each run
uploaded, and cost — not the token count — leads and orders every table.
Cache reads are ~97% of the tokens and ~60% of the bill, so a table ranked by
summed tokens ranks the cheapest work first; the fixtures below make the two
orders disagree so a regression to token-ranking fails.

The fake `gh` serves a run list and materialises each run's artifact into the
`--dir` the script passes, which is the whole of what the script needs from
GitHub. `date` is faked so the window is a fixed string.
