"""Tests for bot-review-state.sh — which of the bot's reviews anchors the head.

Every field here decides an outward action: whether the bot re-reviews a
commit, whether it approves one it never read, whether it edits an existing
review or duplicates it, and whether a stale approval gets dismissed. The
logic used to be copy-pasted across five skill call sites, where the copies
had already drifted; these pin the single implementation they collapsed into.
