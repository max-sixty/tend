"""One-shot migration from `.config/tend.toml` to `.config/tend.yaml`.

Bridges the format change introduced when tend's config switched from TOML
to YAML. The new code path doesn't read TOML anymore, so this command holds
the only `tomllib` import in the codebase — it exists solely to let
existing adopters upgrade without hand-editing.

Verification: the parsed TOML dict and the parsed-back YAML dict must
compare equal. If they don't, the migration aborts and the TOML file is
left in place. Equal dicts mean `Config.load` (which operates on the
parsed dict, not the file format) will produce an identical `Config`, and
therefore identical generated workflows.
