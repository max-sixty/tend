"""Shared machinery for the issues the actions file about their own runs.

``tend-outage`` (``report_failure.py``) and ``tend-rate-limit``

one table format, and both race with sibling jobs failing or tripping at the
same instant.

Callers keep their own policy about a closed issue, because the two differ and
the difference is deliberate: an outage issue closed as resolved must not
swallow the next incident, so ``report_failure`` files a fresh one; the
rate-limit issue is a single long-lived record whose closes *are* the
approvals, so the preflight reopens it.

    Raises ``CalledProcessError`` when the create itself fails; returns
    ``None`` in the one case where the issue was filed but its number could
    not be read off the URL, so the caller can say "the open ``<label>``
    issue" rather than name a number that does not exist.

    *row* is this run's row, and it is required rather than optional: when
    this leg stands down it carries that row onto the keeper first, so an
    incident it recorded is not stranded in the body of a closed duplicate. A
    caller that omitted it would strand the very record this exists to
    preserve.

    Callers sleep a jittered interval before their check-then-act, which
    narrows the window when sibling jobs trip at near-identical times but
    cannot close it: two legs can still both read the list as empty within the
    few seconds the index takes to reflect a fresh create, and each files its
    own.

    The probe goes downwards rather than re-listing, because a settle-then-list
    reconcile reads the same lagging index that lost the race in the first
    place: observed in practice, a sibling created 3 s earlier was still absent
    from the list while one created 6 s earlier was present, so two legs whose
    creates landed in the same second each read back only their own issue and
    closed nothing. ``GET /issues/{n}`` is a primary-key read and returns a
    sibling the instant it exists. Deferring to the *lowest* match rather than
    the nearest is what makes it converge: every leg computes the same keeper
    from its own vantage point, and only higher-numbered legs stand down.

    Self-close-only is a deliberate narrowing: closing every higher duplicate
    a leg could see only ever worked when the lagging list happened to be
    current, which is the very thing that failed in production. This fails
    toward an extra open record rather than scattered rows.
