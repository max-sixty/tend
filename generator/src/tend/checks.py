"""Security checks for tend setup.

Verifies the two boundaries docs/security-model.md claims: the bot cannot
land code (branch protection on configured branches, bot permission level),
and a run the bot can cause reaches no credential (the `tend` environment's
deployment branch policy, every other credential-holding environment's gate,
the operational secrets living in the environment, and no repo-level secret
outside the allowlist).

Uses the `gh` CLI for GitHub API access. Checks degrade gracefully when
gh is unavailable or the token lacks permission. Everything read here is
readable with the bot's own write-scoped token, so the nightly run sees
the same answers a maintainer does.
