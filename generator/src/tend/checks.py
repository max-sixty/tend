"""Security checks for tend setup.

Verifies the boundaries docs/security-model.md claims: the configured merge
policy is exact, the yolo control plane remains maintainer-owned, extra protected
branches and future releases are immutable, and a run the bot can cause
reaches no unintended credential (the `tend` environment's deployment branch
policy, every other credential-holding environment's gate, the operational
secrets living in the environment, and no repo-level secret outside the
allowlist).

Uses the `gh` CLI for GitHub API access. Checks degrade gracefully when
gh is unavailable or the token lacks permission. Everything read here is
readable with the bot's own write-scoped token, so the nightly run sees
the same answers a maintainer does — with one asymmetry: a ruleset's
`bypass_actors` list is served only to repo admins, but every response
carries `current_user_can_bypass`, GitHub's own evaluation of the caller
against that list. A run as the bot reads its verdict there; a run as an
admin reads the list; a token that is neither — or a failed read, or a
listed principal tend cannot resolve — reports unknown.

# A `workflow_dispatch` with no inputs is deliberately absent, as are `push`,
# `create`, `pull_request`, `workflow_run`, `deployment` and `schedule`: each

    A credential is released only to a job naming its environment, so the

    claim a run the bot can cause reaches no credential at all. A gate is a

    only refs verified out of the bot's reach and carrying no trigger the bot
    can steer (`_policy_gate`); either suffices, since each alone stops the
    bot causing a run that the environment feeds. `tend` itself is
    `check_environment`'s job.

    An environment holds a credential when it stores a secret, or when a job
    deploying to it requests `id-token: write` — trusted publishing (PyPI,
    npm, a cloud role) stores no secret, and an environment sweep keyed on
    stored secrets alone walks straight past the repos that publish. Keyed on
    holding one rather than on any name, because a check that reads names
    passes when an environment is renamed or a new one is stood up beside it.

    `id-token: write` outside any environment is the ungated case of the same
    thing: the minted token carries no environment claim, and nothing gates
    the ref it comes from, so a trust policy pinning the repository but not
    the ref accepts one the bot minted from a branch it pushed.
