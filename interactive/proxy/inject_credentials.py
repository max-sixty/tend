"""mitmproxy addon: inject the bot's real credentials into the requests that
need them, so the sandboxed agent never holds the secrets.

Two credentials, one mechanism. This process runs as the privileged runner
user, OUTSIDE the agent's sandbox. The real secrets are read once at startup
and live only in this process's memory. The agent runs as a separate, non-sudo
UID and therefore cannot read this process's environment
(``/proc/<pid>/environ`` is owner-only) or escalate to it. The agent holds only
throwaway dummies; every request it makes to an allowlisted host has its
credential header replaced here with the real one.

- **GitHub** (``TEND_GH_TOKEN``): the git smart-HTTP hosts authenticate with
  Basic (token as the password); the REST/upload hosts take the ``token``
  scheme.
- **Anthropic** (``TEND_ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN`` or ``TEND_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``):
  ``api.anthropic.com`` only. The agent's ``claude`` binary runs in the SAME
  auth mode with a dummy secret, so it already emits every mode-specific header
  (``anthropic-beta``, ``anthropic-version``, ``x-api-key`` vs
  ``Authorization``); this addon only swaps the dummy secret value for the real
  one. OAuth wins when both are set, matching the action's input precedence.

Security boundary: the injection allowlist below is exact-match on
``flow.request.host`` — the real connection target, NOT ``pretty_host``, which
mitmproxy derives from the spoofable client-supplied Host header. A request to
any other host (including ``api.github.com.evil.com`` or a host intercepted by
misconfiguration) is passed through untouched. The proxy's ``--allow-hosts``
flag is a functionality optimization (don't TLS-intercept non-allowlisted
traffic, so package managers keep working); this allowlist is the credential
boundary.
