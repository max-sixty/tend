"""Accounts a run's token usage and publishes it three ways.

Run as ``token_usage.py --harness {claude,codex}`` from the "Token usage" step
of either composite action. That step is ``if: always()`` — a cancelled or
failed run still has to report what it spent — so nothing here may fail the
job: every copy is best-effort and every parse tolerates a torn line.

Reads (env):
  MODEL             - model name, copied through to the record; may be empty
  STREAM_JSON       - claude: the headless run's stream-json (NDJSON of SDK
                      message events); may be empty or name a missing file
  AGENT_HOME        - the sandbox user's home, exported by
                      setup_sandbox.py via ``$GITHUB_ENV``. Unset when setup
                      died early, which is why consolidation tolerates it
  RUNNER_TEMP       - parent of the consolidated log dir, and where Claude's
                      stderr log was written
  SANDBOX_REAPED    - ``true`` after the harness has stopped every sandbox
                      process; agent-owned session trees are copied only then
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY - the record's ``repo``; on claude it also gates the raw
                      stream-json copy to tend's own repo
  GITHUB_WORKFLOW, GITHUB_RUN_ID, GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT, GITHUB_EVENT_NAME,
  GITHUB_SHA, GITHUB_EVENT_PATH
                    - the rest of :func:`run_context`

Writes ``token-usage.json`` into the consolidated log dir (uploaded as the
session-log artifact), the ``usage`` step output (compact JSON), and a
``## Token Usage`` table in the job summary. The record's shape mirrors the
interactive harness so downstream consumers (review-reviewers' evidence gist,
token_report.py, dashboards) don't branch on harness.

Every record also names the run it came from, so spend can be grouped by
subject; see :func:`run_context`. The job summary stays counts-only, because
the run page it is rendered on already names the run.

Claude's accounting has three paths, tried in order:

1. The stream-json's ``type: "result"`` events. Sessions that use
   ``run_in_background: true`` Bash emit a second ``result`` on wakeup;
   ``usage.*`` and ``num_turns`` are per-event while ``total_cost_usd`` is
   cumulative, so the per-event fields are summed and cost taken from the last.
2. No result event: the session JSONL this step has just consolidated. A
   cancelled session never emits a result, and ``tend-triage`` runs with
   ``cancel-in-progress: true``, so this is routine rather than exotic — the
   run may have done dozens of turns and already posted its comment.
3. Neither: the agent never ran (a preflight failure, say). That run genuinely
   cost nothing, so it reports a real zero rather than flagging an unknown.

Path 2 reads the session JSONL, NOT the stream-json, even though both carry
``type: "assistant"`` events. The stream's are non-final (``stop_reason:
null``): ``usage.output_tokens`` is the message-start placeholder — single
digits against thousands — while the input and cache fields, known at message
start, do match. Summing the stream's events would under-count output by
orders of magnitude and look plausible doing it.

Both files record each assistant message roughly twice, hence the dedupe by
``message.id``. ``<session-id>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`` is skipped: every
``Task`` subagent gets its own transcript there and the bounded tree export
brings the subtree along, but the ``result`` event path
2 stands in for counts only the main loop — slurping the subagents alongside it
inflates every field (turns roughly doubles) and makes partial runs
incomparable with complete ones.

``partial: true`` marks path 2, and its ``cost_usd`` is null because only
``result.total_cost_usd`` carries cost and that is the event this path does not
have. A ``0`` there would repeat the bug the fallback exists to fix, one field
down; ``partial`` is what keeps a reconstructed total distinguishable from a
run that really cost nothing.

Codex has one path: consolidate the sandbox user's rollouts, then take the last
cumulative token count from each ``sessions/**/rollout-*.jsonl``. That schema
isn't versioned, so a missing field counts as zero — and no rollouts at all is
the same computation over no events, which yields the all-zero record on its
own. Codex includes cached tokens in ``input_tokens``; ``cached_input_tokens``
is the subset served from cache. Cost stays 0: the Codex CLI doesn't surface
API list prices and computing them here would mean maintaining a price table.
