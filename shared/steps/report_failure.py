"""File or append to a `tend-outage` issue when a run fails.

Shared verbatim by both harness actions; the caller gates it on the job being
red, so a failure anywhere in the action — the rate-limit preflight and
sandbox build ahead of the agent as much as the agent itself — lands in the
tracker. The one exclusion is the security preflight: that failure is a
persistent config refusal rather than an outage, and the issue this files
("temporarily unavailable", closed once resolved) would never resolve.

Records the run link, plus the one remedy the tracker can name for itself: a
pin behind the current release (see :func:`remedy_note`). Error annotations and
logs are not reliably available while the job is in_progress, so the nightly
skill enriches these issues after the fact, when the run has completed and the
APIs return stable data.

A closed outage issue is left closed and a fresh one filed. The `review-runs`
sweep closes it after diagnosing every row and checking the live repository for
work the failed runs may have missed. Reopening would fold the next incident
into a stale record. Nightly leaves this label alone because its cron precedes
`review-runs`, and a clean recent run says nothing about missed work. Where a
consumer disables `review-runs`, a maintainer applies the same close criterion.
The rate-limit issue takes the opposite policy, for reasons in ``_issue.py``.

Repeated appends are bounded per run, not per incident: a matrix workflow runs
this once per leg and every leg shares one ``GITHUB_RUN_ID``, so the tracker
takes at most one row per run. The guard is a check-then-act, so
:func:`duplicate_rows` reconciles the legs that raced it down to that one row.

Inputs (env): ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` (for ``gh``), ``GITHUB_SERVER_URL``,
``GITHUB_REPOSITORY``, ``GITHUB_RUN_ID``, ``GITHUB_EVENT_NAME``,
``GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`` (from Actions), and ``TEND_ACTION_REF`` /
``TEND_ACTION_REPOSITORY``, which the caller passes because
:func:`remedy_note` cannot read them for itself.
