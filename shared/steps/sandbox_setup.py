"""Finishes preparing the sandbox, immediately before the agent runs.

Executes the adopter's ``sandbox_setup:`` commands (from ``.config/tend.yaml``,
threaded in as ``TEND_SANDBOX_SETUP``) INSIDE the sandbox, as the non-sudo
sandbox user, then reports which commands the runner can resolve and the agent
cannot.

``sandbox_setup:`` is the general lever runner-side ``setup:`` cannot provide:
``setup:`` runs as the runner user around the composite action, while these
commands run with the same launch env the agent gets (``$AGENT_ENV_FILE``:
proxy routing, CA trust, dummy credentials, plus any ``sandbox_path`` /
``sandbox_env`` additions) and with the workspace as the working directory.

Env-only tweaks (PATH, exported vars) do NOT persist to the agent from here — a
child shell's exports die with it. Use ``sandbox_path:`` / ``sandbox_env:`` for
those; use ``sandbox_setup:`` for actions with on-disk effects (installing a
tool, warming a cache, generating a file).

Inputs (env): ``TEND_SANDBOX_SETUP`` (the commands; empty → the report only),
``SANDBOX``, ``AGENT_ENV_FILE``, ``AGENT_PATH`` and ``TEND_BLOCKED_PATH``
(exported by ``proxy/setup-sandbox.sh`` via ``$GITHUB_ENV``), plus the
``GITHUB_*`` context from Actions. Used by the Claude harness action.
