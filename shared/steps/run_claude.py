"""Runs the agent and decides the step's verdict.

Composes the agent's settings and launch env, starts it as the non-sudo sandbox
user, supervises it to exit or timeout, then turns the finished stream-json into
the step's exit code and ``::error::`` annotation.

Reads (env): ``SANDBOX`` and ``AGENT_ENV_FILE`` (exported by
``proxy/setup-sandbox.sh`` via ``$GITHUB_ENV``), ``RUNNER_TEMP``,
``GITHUB_WORKSPACE``, ``GITHUB_OUTPUT``, ``TEND_MODEL``,
``TEND_ALLOWED_TOOLS``, ``TEND_SYSTEM_PROMPT``, ``TEND_PROMPT``,
``TEND_TIMEOUT_SEC``, ``SHOW_FULL_OUTPUT``, ``BOT_NAME``, ``BOT_ID``, optional
``TEND_AUTO_MEMORY_SETTINGS``, ``CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB``, plus the
``GITHUB_*`` context from Actions. ``GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`` is read only when
rendering the transcript.
Publishes ``stream_json`` and, after supervision has stopped every sandbox
process, ``sandbox_reaped``. Used by the Claude harness action.

Decisions this module owns:

* **The supervisor times the run, so nothing infers the bound from an exit
  code.** Waiting with a timeout raises on the bound, which is the answer; a
  code cannot give it, since a killed agent and a crashing one both land on the
  same numbers and the agent may return them itself.
* **A zero exit does NOT mean the turn succeeded.** ``claude -p`` exits 0 on
  rate limits, max turns, auth failures and a failed final model request, and
  ``is_error: true`` occurs even on subtype ``success``. The last ``result``
  event decides; a turn with no result event never completed.
