"""Runs the agent and decides the step's verdict.

Inside the shared SRT lifecycle, composes the agent's settings and launch env,
supervises it to exit or timeout, then turns the finished stream-json into the
step's exit code and ``::error::`` annotation.

Reads (env): ``RUNNER_TEMP``,
``GITHUB_WORKSPACE``, ``TEND_MODEL``,
``TEND_EFFORT``, ``TEND_ARGS``, ``TEND_ALLOWED_TOOLS``,
``TEND_SYSTEM_PROMPT``, ``TEND_PROMPT``, ``TEND_TIMEOUT_SEC``,
``SHOW_FULL_OUTPUT``, ``BOT_NAME``, ``BOT_ID``, optional
``TEND_AUTO_MEMORY_SETTINGS``, ``CLAUDE_CODE_SUBPROCESS_ENV_SCRUB``, plus the
``GITHUB_*`` context from Actions. ``GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`` is read only when
rendering the transcript.
The trusted outer supervisor reaps the sandbox UID, copies the fixed
``RUNNER_TEMP/tend-stream.json`` file through a no-follow bounded read, and
publishes the runner-owned path plus ``sandbox_reaped``.

Decisions this module owns:

* **The supervisor times the run, so nothing infers the bound from an exit
  code.** Waiting with a timeout raises on the bound, which is the answer; a
  code cannot give it, since a killed agent and a crashing one both land on the
  same numbers and the agent may return them itself.
* **A zero exit does NOT mean the turn succeeded.** ``claude -p`` exits 0 on
  rate limits, max turns, auth failures and a failed final model request, and
  ``is_error: true`` occurs even on subtype ``success``. The last ``result``
  event decides; a turn with no result event never completed.
