# Compose the system prompt from shared/system-prompt.md (harness-neutral bulk:
# conduct, scope, precedence) plus a Claude-specific skill-loading directive and
# a CI-autonomy directive, then append the adopter's `system_prompt_append`
# input if non-empty. Shared by the two Claude harness actions. Codex consumes
# the same shared/system-prompt.md from codex/action.yaml — keep edits to that
# file in sync across both engines.
#
# Emits the composed prompt to $GITHUB_OUTPUT under `value`, which the caller
# exposes as steps.<id>.outputs.value.
#
# Inputs (env): SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE (absolute path to shared/system-prompt.md;
# differs per action by checkout depth), BOT_NAME, EXTRA (system_prompt_append),
# GITHUB_OUTPUT (from Actions).
