"""Mark the notification thread for the triggering event read.

The scheduled ``tend-notifications`` poll otherwise burns tokens rediscovering
work this run already did. Shared verbatim by both harness actions, which gate
the step on a successful run (``if: success()``).

Decisions this encodes:

- A thread is marked only when its ``updated_at`` predates this run's start.
  Activity that arrived mid-run is what the next workflow run has to see, so
  it stays unread.
- Without ``run_started_at`` that comparison cannot be made, and marking
  unconditionally would swallow exactly the mid-run activity the guard exists
  to preserve — so a failed or absent timestamp skips this cycle and leaves
  the thread to the scheduled poll.
- The agent run already succeeded, so nothing here may fail the step: a
  transient API error warns and returns 0.
- ``issue_comment`` fires for both issues and PR conversation comments, but a
  PR notification's ``subject.url`` always names ``/pulls/N``; the issue's
  ``pull_request`` field is what tells the two apart.
- Review events reach tend-mention re-posted by tend-mention-relay as
  ``repository_dispatch``, whose ``client_payload.pr`` names the PR.

Inputs (env): ``GITHUB_EVENT_NAME``, ``GITHUB_EVENT_PATH``,
``GITHUB_REPOSITORY``, ``GITHUB_RUN_ID`` (from Actions), plus the bot's
``GITHUB_TOKEN``, which reaches ``gh`` through the environment.
