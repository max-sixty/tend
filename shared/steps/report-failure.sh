# File or append to a `tend-outage` issue when a run fails, so outages are
# tracked until resolved. Shared verbatim by both harness actions; the caller
# gates it on the job being red, so a failure anywhere in the action — the
# rate-limit preflight and sandbox build ahead of the agent as much as the
# agent itself — lands in the tracker. The one exclusion is the security
# preflight: that failure is a persistent config refusal rather than an
# outage, and the issue this files ("temporarily unavailable", closed once
# resolved) would never resolve.
#
# Just records the run link. Error annotations and logs are not reliably
# available while the job is in_progress, so the nightly skill enriches these
# issues after the fact, when the run has completed and the APIs return stable
# data.
#
# A closed outage issue is left closed and a fresh one filed: closing it means
# the outage was resolved, and reopening would fold the next incident into a
# stale record. The rate-limit issue takes the opposite policy, for reasons in
# lib/run-issue.sh.
#
# Inputs (env): GITHUB_TOKEN (for gh), GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_REPOSITORY,
# GITHUB_RUN_ID, GITHUB_EVENT_NAME, GITHUB_EVENT_PATH (from Actions).
