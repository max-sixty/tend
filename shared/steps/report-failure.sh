# tracked until resolved. Shared verbatim by all three harness actions; the
# caller gates it on the agent step having failed.
#
# Just records the run link. Error annotations and logs are not reliably
# available while the job is in_progress, so the nightly skill enriches these
# issues after the fact, when the run has completed and the APIs return stable
# data.
