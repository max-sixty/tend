# Instruction files are trusted repo guidance at any depth, not only the root.
# Claude Code loads the CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md, or AGENTS.md nearest the
# file the agent opens, and the skills under any directory's .claude/; Codex
# reads the AGENTS.md beside the files it opens and discovers skills under
# .agents/. So a fork's `site/CLAUDE.md` reaches the session as readily as a
# root one. The bare directory pathspecs catch a fork symlink planted at the
# `.claude` or `.agents` component itself, which the contents globs can't match.
# shellcheck disable=SC2034  # read by the sourcing scripts

# pin_to_base <ref> <pathspec>... — make the worktree match <ref> for every
# path the pathspecs cover. One `git restore --source` call does all of it: it
# writes <ref>'s version of each path, removes the ones <ref> lacks, and
# replaces a fork-planted symlink instead of writing through it. When a path is
# a symlink or file on one side and a directory on the other, the diff names
# both that path and its children. Restoring only the topmost changed path lets
# Git replace the path before it considers anything beneath it.
# `--worktree` leaves the index at HEAD, so the revert doesn't ride into commits
# the agent makes later, and the fork's version stays readable at
# `git show HEAD:<path>` for a review that wants to see what the PR changed.
# `--no-renames` keeps both ends of a file the fork moved in the changed-path
# list; with rename detection the diff would name only the destination.
# `--ignore-submodules=none` keeps a fork's .gitmodules from hiding a gitlink
# it planted at one of these paths. `wait` surfaces the diff's own exit status,
# which the process substitution would otherwise drop: an unresolvable <ref>
# fails the step instead of pinning nothing.
