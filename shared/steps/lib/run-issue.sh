# Shared machinery for the issues the actions file about their own runs:
# `tend-outage` (report-failure.sh) and `tend-rate-limit`
# (rate-limit-preflight.sh). Both name the run and the trigger it stranded in
# one table format, and both race with sibling jobs failing or tripping at the
# same instant.
#
# Sourced, not executed. Callers keep their own policy about a closed issue,
# because the two differ and the difference is deliberate: an outage issue
# closed as resolved must not swallow the next incident, so report-failure
# files a fresh one; the rate-limit issue is a single long-lived record whose
# closes *are* the approvals, so the preflight reopens it.

# Inputs (env, from Actions): GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_REPOSITORY,
# GITHUB_RUN_ID, GITHUB_EVENT_NAME, GITHUB_EVENT_PATH.

# A one-line reference to the triggering context, for the Trigger column.
# This is the only pointer back to the work a refused or failed run stranded,
# so every trigger that carries one names it; `// empty` keeps a missing field
# out of the cell as blank rather than the literal `null` jq would print, and
# the caller's `${REF:-N/A}` turns that into N/A. Empty for events with no
# thread of their own (schedule, workflow_dispatch).
