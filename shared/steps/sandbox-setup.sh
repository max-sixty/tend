# Run the adopter's `sandbox_setup:` commands (from .config/tend.yaml, threaded
# in as TEND_SANDBOX_SETUP) INSIDE the sandbox, as the non-sudo sandbox user,
# after the toolchain and plugins are installed and just before the agent runs.
# This is the general lever runner-side `setup:` can't provide: `setup:` runs as
# the runner user around the composite action and never reaches the sandbox
# env. Commands run with the same launch env the agent gets ($AGENT_ENV_FILE:
# proxy routing, CA trust, dummy credentials, plus any sandbox_path/sandbox_env
# additions) and with the workspace as the working directory.
#
# Env-only tweaks (PATH, exported vars) do NOT persist to the agent from here —
# a child shell's exports die with it. Use `sandbox_path:` / `sandbox_env:` for
# those; use `sandbox_setup:` for actions with on-disk effects (installing a
# tool, warming a cache, generating a file).
#
# Inputs (env): TEND_SANDBOX_SETUP (the commands; empty → no-op), SANDBOX and
# AGENT_ENV_FILE (exported by setup-sandbox.sh via $GITHUB_ENV). Shared by the
# two Claude harness actions.
