"""The agent launch and the verdict it produces.

The launch tests replace ``subprocess.run``: what is under test is the crossing
this module composes — argv, env order, the runner-owned redirects, the bound
and the reap — not a second uid. ``proxy/test-setup-sandbox.sh``'s
``verify-launch`` phase drives the real thing on a hosted runner.

The verdict tests need no agent, no credential and no second uid — every input
is a file or a scalar — so each branch is reachable from a fixture.
