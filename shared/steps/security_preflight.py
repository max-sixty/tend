"""Refuse to run unless the default branch matches Tend's merge policy.

Shared verbatim by both harness actions (``claude/``, ``codex/``), where the
step is ``id: security`` and a non-zero exit is what the "Report failure" step
reads off ``steps.security.outcome``.

The step runs with the bot's own token, so ``current_user_can_bypass`` is
GitHub's direct answer. Maintainer mode accepts a non-bypassable update rule (or the
legacy protected-branch floor). Yolo requires the exact middle state: the bot
may bypass an update rule only through a pull request, and a separate rule
requires fresh CODEOWNER approval that the bot cannot bypass.

Decisions this encodes:

- A ruleset whose ``current_user_can_bypass`` cannot be read proves nothing
  either way, so it neither blocks nor counts as bypassable; the run falls
  through to the ``.protected`` floor if no other update rule settles it.
- Any readable value other than ``never`` counts as bypassable, JSON ``null``
  included — an answer that isn't "never" is not a restriction.
- A rules listing that cannot be read — or that comes back in a shape this
  cannot make rules out of — is treated as "no update rules apply", the same
  fallback the shell body took, so a token that cannot see rulesets still
  meets the ``.protected`` floor rather than passing unchecked.

Inputs (env): ``GITHUB_REPOSITORY``, ``TEND_MERGE``, plus the bot's
``GITHUB_TOKEN``, which reaches ``gh`` through the environment.
