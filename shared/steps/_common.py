"""Helpers shared by the Python step bodies in this directory.

A step body is a flat module beside this one, run by the composite action as
``/usr/bin/python3 -E -s <action_path>/../shared/steps/<name>.py`` with its
inputs in the environment, exactly as the shell bodies were. Only the standard
library is available: the steps run on the runner's ``/usr/bin/python3``, before
and without tend's own ``uv``. That is 3.12 on the pinned ubuntu-24.04 image,
but an adopter can select an older image through the documented ``runs-on``
override, so these modules stay 3.10-compatible.

Every GitHub call goes through :func:`gh`, and every step module calls it as
``_common.gh(...)`` rather than importing the name, so a test replaces one
attribute (the ``fake_gh`` fixture in ``conftest.py``) instead of standing up a
shim on ``PATH``.

The runner reads ``::``-prefixed workflow commands from the start of any line a
step prints. Text a step did not write itself — the agent's stderr, a comment
body — is printed inside :func:`stop_commands`, which brackets it with a
per-run token so it can neither post annotations nor switch command processing
off for the steps that follow.
