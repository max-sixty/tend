# Tend follow-ups

Deferred work and unimplemented options. Each entry should justify the cost
of building it if revisited.

## Re-evaluate reader-focused public prose after release

The bundled skills now give the model the reader's context and decision goal,
while keeping a small number of output shapes as optional examples. After a
release has accumulated a sample comparable to the baseline below, review PR
descriptions, top-level reviews, and issue replies separately. Visible word
counts and long paragraphs are useful alerts, but the judgment is whether the
visible text states the conclusion, consequence, and required action without
replaying the investigation, and whether optional examples have become de
facto templates again.

PR baseline (2026-09-01 through 2026-09-06, six consumers on 0.1.24): 93 PRs
had a median 243 visible words; 40% had at least 300 visible words, and 39% had
a visible paragraph of at least 100 words. Comment baseline (2026-08-20 through
2026-09-06, seven active consumers): 629 review bodies had a median 1,984
characters, 500 general PR comments had a median 1,734, and 164 issue, triage,
and mention comments had a median 2,179. The comment sample excludes run
trackers and enrichment payloads.

If the new guidance improves synthesis without dropping useful context, keep
the examples. If it does not, use the observed failures to remove an example
or sharpen the goal rather than adding a hard length limit.

## Cut tend over to harness = "codex" (post-release)

The Codex harness landed but tend itself still runs on Claude. The cutover
needs the release sequence:

1. Land the harness support PR on `main`.
2. Cut a release so the new tag (with `codex/action.yaml`) is what the
   version-pinned action ref resolves to.
3. Edit `.config/tend.yaml`: add `harness: codex` (and optionally
   `effort: medium`) and `model: gpt-5.6-sol`.
4. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret on `max-sixty/tend`.
   Drop `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` from `secrets.allowed` once unused.
5. `uvx tend@latest init` to regenerate workflows. Commit both the config
   and the regenerated `tend-*.yaml` files in one commit.
6. The first nightly run after merge dogfoods the new path; watch
   `/activity` for the first review/triage and confirm token-usage parsing
   reports non-zero values.

Doing this in the same PR that ships the action would temporarily break
tend's own CI between merge and the release tag bump.

## Thread memory: deterministic prep of prior conversations

A thread's session logs share one artifact name per harness, so
`running-in-ci` finds its prior runs with a single `?name=` call, and the
agent downloads and parses them on demand. The lookup is cheap; the
cost is the agent reading raw logs (a session JSONL runs ~100 KB, ~30k
tokens) each time it opens one.

A deterministic action step would condense each matched log to its posted
text, files touched, and key reasoning (~1-2k tokens) with `jq` before the
agent sees it, stage that index on disk at a path the skill reads (or
prepend a pointer to the prompt, as the action already does for the CI
directive), and let the agent open a full JSONL only when the digest isn't
enough.

Worth building once usage shows the agent reaches for thread history often
enough that the per-log read cost is material. Until then the agent-driven
path covers the same ground, and survives no longer than the 30-day
artifact retention either way.

## Auth: GitHub App alternatives to PAT — not planned

**Not planned (2026-06-14).** Both alternatives below replace the classic
PAT with a GitHub App installation token (~1 h lifetime, repo-scoped). This
would reduce the impact of a token stolen through a compromised runner or
credential proxy. Neither is being pursued: both require tend to stand up
and operate a hosted service (a token-minting endpoint or a full webhook
handler), which gives up tend's defining property of stamping workflow files
into the adopter's repo and running nothing of its own. The credential proxy
keeps the PAT out of the agent on both harnesses, and the environment gate keeps
it out of any workflow the bot can start on its own. Cross-repository GitHub
access through the live proxy is intended behavior, not part of this analysis.

### Model A: token-minting service

Adopter installs our GitHub App; `tend init` generates the same workflow
files. The only auth change is an OIDC call to our service that mints a
scoped installation token per workflow run. Workflows still live and run
in the adopter's repo.

```yaml
- uses: max-sixty/tend/auth@X.Y.Z   # OIDC → our service → scoped token
  id: auth
- uses: actions/checkout@v6
  with:
    token: ${{ steps.auth.outputs.token }}
- uses: max-sixty/tend/claude@X.Y.Z
  with:
    github_token: ${{ steps.auth.outputs.token }}
    claude_code_oauth_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
```

Trust model: standard GitHub App — adopters trust the App by installing it,
like installing Codecov or Renovate. We hold the App private key; adopters
hold their own Claude OAuth token. A workflow-run OIDC token
(`id-token: write`) proves the caller's repo identity to our service.

Could be extended to push workflow updates via PR, but that requires a
webhook handler to detect config changes.

### Model B: full webhook handler

Adopter installs our GitHub App, adds `.config/tend.yaml`, done — no
workflow files. GitHub sends raw events to our service; we run the logic
(engagement verification, concurrency, dispatch) and execute Claude on our
infrastructure (or dispatch back to the adopter's runners).

Most cohesive UX, and partially addresses the fork-PR gap — we receive
inline review-comment webhooks regardless of fork status.

Trade-offs: a compromise of our infra exposes write access to every
adopter's repo *and* their code. Anthropic token has three options:

- Adopter hands it to us; we hold it. If our service is compromised, the
  attacker gets every adopter's Claude token.
- We provide Claude access and bill the adopter. Simpler for them; we take
  on billing and usage management.
- `workflow_dispatch` back to their runners. Token stays in their secrets;
  adds latency and complexity.

## Auth: triage + fork privilege model

Currently only `write + branch protection` exists. The planned `mode` field
in `.config/tend.yaml` would select between two models:

| | **Triage + fork** | **Write + branch protection** (current) |
|---|---|---|
| Bot collaborator level | Triage | Write |
| Bot pushes code to | Own fork | Target repo branches |
| Creates PRs | From fork | Same-repo |
| Approvals count for required reviews | No | Yes |
| Branch protection required | **No** | **Yes** — primary security boundary |
| Leaked PAT blast radius | Comments/reviews; fork write only | Full write to target repo |
| Setup complexity | Low | Medium |

`Triage + fork` would be the recommended default. The bot pushes to its
own fork and creates cross-fork PRs:

```bash
git remote add fork https://x-access-token:${TEND_BOT_TOKEN}@github.com/${BOT_NAME}/${REPO}.git
git push fork fix/ci-123
gh pr create --repo ${TARGET_REPO} --head ${BOT_NAME}:fix/ci-123
```

Limitations: triage-level approvals don't satisfy required-review policies,
and triage can't push to human PR branches — the bot posts review
suggestions instead.

## Security hardening — deferred

From the old `docs/security-model.md` "what we could do but don't" — none
implemented yet:

- **Haiku pre-screening of diffs.** Cheap fast-model pass scanning for
  suspicious patterns (build-script modifications, `curl | sh`,
  base64-encoded strings, env-var reads targeting secret names). ~$0.001
  per PR. Not a security boundary (trivial to evade) but useful as a
  tripwire against unsophisticated attacks.
- **Read-only mode for fork PRs.** Restrict `allowed_tools` to
  `Glob`/`Grep`/`Read` + comment-posting MCP tools — no
  `Bash`/`Edit`/`Write`. Closes the attacker-controlled-code-execution
  gap entirely for fork PRs; trade-off is no suggested fixes on fork PRs,
  only reviews.
- **Network isolation.** Self-hosted runners with outbound traffic
  restricted to GitHub and Anthropic API endpoints. Not viable on
  GitHub-hosted runners; significant infra overhead self-hosted.

## Security channel for `tend check` drift (PVR)

The nightly `tend check` step (`plugins/tend-ci-runner/skills/nightly/`)
files one normal tracking issue for any configuration drift. Some failures
are real security regressions — missing branch protection, bot escalated to
`admin`, a deploy token (e.g. `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`) at repo level
reachable from fork-triggered runs — others are benign drift (a runtime
token needing allowlisting, a missing secret). On a *public* repo a labeled
public issue broadcasts the misconfig before it's fixed.

GitHub's native private channel is **Private Vulnerability Reporting**: a
draft repository security advisory (`POST
/repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories` or the `/reports` intake) is
maintainer-private — no CVE/GHSA entry, no Dependabot alerts until
published. Deferred because:

- **Semantic misfit.** Advisories model a vulnerability in the *shipped
  package* (ecosystem, version ranges, CVSS), not a misconfiguration of
  tend's deployment. An accidental "Publish" creates a bogus GHSA.
- **Automation ergonomics.** The nightly loop needs idempotent
  find-one / refresh-footer / close-when-green — `gh issue list --search`
  gives that; an advisory's draft→triage→publish lifecycle doesn't.
- **Permission.** A maintainer draft advisory needs repo `admin`; the bot
  has `write`. Whether the `/reports` intake works with the bot's PAT (and
  whether PVR is enabled) is unverified.

If pursued: keep the tracking issue for operational drift, additionally
open a draft advisory for security-classified failures. Needs (a) the
discrimination rule (fix narrows a credential's scope → security; fix
updates config to reflect intent → drift), (b) `install-tend` enabling PVR
at setup, (c) confirming the bot token can hit the reports endpoint.

## Re-run the work a rate-limit trip refused

The `tend-rate-limit` issue lists the runs the spike limit refused, and
closing it approves the volume — but nothing re-runs them. `tend-review`
fires only on `pull_request_target`, so a refused review stays missing until
someone pushes to the PR again. Today the recovery is one
`gh run rerun <id> --failed` per row.

The shape: a generated workflow on `issues: closed`, filtered to the label
and to a closer who isn't the bot (the same check the preflight makes),
re-running rows from the last 24 hours whose run is still in `failure` —
which makes it idempotent, and stops an old row resurrecting itself. It
needs `actions: write` and, being generated, a template plus config
plumbing and generator tests. A re-run re-executes the preflight, which now
sees the approval and passes, so nothing loops.

**Blocked on** confirming tend's re-runs work correctly in the first place.
Building an automatic re-runner over a broken re-run path would bury that
bug under a second mechanism: the symptom moves from "my review never came
back" to "the recovery workflow ran and my review still never came back".

The same gap covers `tend-outage`; #816 tracks it from that side, and the
`review-runs` skill's drain recipe reads the same table format.

## Decide whether the built-in `/code-review` replaces the vendored port

`plugins/tend-ci-runner/skills/code-review/` is a copy of Claude Code's
built-in `/code-review`, taken from a 2.1.220 binary. The two share their
method almost verbatim — the same ten angles, the same three-verdict verify
with "PLAUSIBLE by default", the same sweep — so the copy buys nothing on
method and costs the usual: it drifts silently, and nothing re-checks it
against the binary.

That drift is no longer hypothetical. 2.1.226 restructured the built-in without
touching those texts, and `claude/action.yaml` has been pinned at or beyond
2.1.226 ever since, so the copy is behind the binary CI runs — and the thing
that changed is exactly what decides this question.

Reaching the built-in is possible. It carries `disable-model-invocation`,
which the `Skill` tool waives for a turn whose own user message names the
command, so a prompt naming `/code-review` in prose rather than opening with a
slash unlocks it for the run. That was built and reverted, because reading the
built-in out of the 2.1.226 binary says it isn't worth reaching:

- It is a model × effort matrix rather than one prompt, and `claude-opus-5` at
  both `medium` and `high` — where tend lands, running `model: opus` with no
  effort set — renders a minimal cell: one careful diff pass, no angles, no
  verify, no sweep. That cell is marked as externally measured, so it is a
  deliberate upstream choice rather than an oversight. The port's core-logic
  band is broader than it, and broader than the `default` row's 3+5 angles.
- It reports through `ReportFindings`, which `claude/action.yaml` does not
  allowlist.
- The Codex harness has no built-in at all, so the port stays the only
  implementation there regardless.

Revisit when one of those moves: a pinned version whose Opus row is
angle-based again, `ReportFindings` in the allowlist, or a Codex equivalent.
Cutting over then costs a prompt reshape plus a per-harness branch in the
`review` skill's step 5, which only pays once the built-in is the better pass.

## Worker: Phase 2 LLM summary of `/activity`

A consumer (scheduled job or the Worker calling Claude) reads `/activity`
and writes a short prose summary of what tend's been up to; the summary
lives in KV and is what the site renders. If the summary wants a longer
span than the last week (beyond GitHub's ~90-day events window or one
Search page), a KV/D1 accumulator that appends activity as it arrives
earns its keep — until then, demand-fetch is cheap enough.
