Tend allows open-source projects to have an agent as a dutiful junior
maintainer. The agent can review PRs, triage issues, fix CI, help out with
research, maintain a changelog, sweep the repo for improvements, refine
documentation, etc.

> Current status: Tend is in its early days. It has been working _extremely_ well in
> [Worktrunk](https://www.github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk) for the past couple of
> months, such that folks suggested I generalize it into its own project.

## Structure

To use Tend, a project needs:

- A GitHub account for the agent (for example this project's is **[@tend-agent](https://www.github.com/tend-agent))**
- One of:
  - A Claude Max subscription (harness = "claude")
  - An OpenAI API key (harness = "codex"). A ChatGPT subscription via
    a Codex `auth.json` is **not** compatible with tend's concurrent
    workflows — see [Codex (alternative)](#codex-alternative).

Tend offers the default code & guidance for the agent. Specifically that means:

- A set of workflow templates
- A very particular set of Skills
  - ...skills it has acquired over a very long career (two months)

Each project's agent remains completely under its control, and runs only in the
project's Github Actions environment. The Tend project never sees any tokens /
keys / etc.

<!-- TODO: add screenshot of a review comment, triage response, or CI fix PR -->

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started is to install the Tend plugin into a local Claude
Code session, and run the [`/install-tend` skill](plugins/install-tend/skills/install-tend/SKILL.md):

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add max-sixty/tend
claude plugin install install-tend@tend
claude /install-tend
```

It'll take 5-15 minutes to set up the config, workflow generation, bot account,
secrets, and branch protection. Tend is configured through a [config
file](docs/tend.example.yaml) and a repo-local `/running-tend` skill.

## Reasons _not_ to use Tend

- Tend uses lots of tokens. A Claude subscription, an Anthropic API key,
  an OpenAI API key, or a ChatGPT plan is needed to fund the runs.
  - Maintainers of sizeable OSS projects [get a 20x Claude Max subscription
    for free from
    Anthropic](https://claude.com/contact-sales/claude-for-oss).
- While it's built to protect important secrets, a determined attacker can
  get a) the bot's token and b) the harness auth credential (Claude OAuth
  token, OpenAI API key, or ChatGPT auth.json). They can't do that much
  with these: burn some tokens and close some issues.
  - They specifically _cannot_ merge to the default branch, nor create releases.

## Workflows

| Workflow          | Trigger                    | What happens                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **review**        | PR opened/updated          | Reviews for correctness and duplication. Traces error paths. Monitors CI. Pushes fixes to bot-authored PRs.                                                 |
| **mention**       | @bot mention, review       | Responds to requests in PR and issue conversations.                                                                                                         |
| **triage**        | Issue opened               | Classifies the issue, checks for duplicates, reproduces bugs, attempts conservative fixes.                                                                  |
| **ci-fix**        | CI fails on default branch | Reads failure logs, identifies root cause, searches for the same pattern elsewhere, opens a fix PR.                                                         |
| **nightly**       | Daily                      | Resolves conflicts on open PRs, reviews recent commits, surveys ~10 files for bugs and stale docs, closes resolved issues, regenerates tend workflow files. |
| **weekly**        | Weekly                     | Reviews dependency PRs, approves safe patch and minor updates (the bot never merges — a merge restriction is the security boundary).                        |
| **notifications** | Every 15 minutes           | Drains unread notifications as a recovery queue and repairs conflicts on bot-authored PRs.                                                                  |
| **review-runs**   | Daily                      | Reviews recent CI runs for behavioral problems and proposes skill/config improvements.                                                                      |

The bot reacts 👀 while a session is working: on an issue when it opens, on a
PR whenever a review starts, and on a comment that mentions the bot. The
reaction comes off when the session ends.

Scheduled workflows also support manual dispatch for testing. GitHub runs
`schedule` triggers on a best-effort basis and drops ticks under load, so
the intervals above are the requested cadence rather than a guarantee —
observed gaps between runs are routinely longer. All are generated by
default except **ci-fix**, which requires `watched_workflows` to be
configured. Any can be omitted on the next regeneration:

```yaml
workflows:
  weekly:
    enabled: false
```

## How it works

`uvx tend@latest init` reads `.config/tend.yaml` and writes `tend-*.yaml` workflow
files into `.github/workflows/`. Each workflow handles triggers, skip
conditions, concurrency, and permissions — then calls the composite action
for the configured harness, pinned to the released generator version
(`max-sixty/tend/claude@X.Y.Z` for Claude, `max-sixty/tend/codex@X.Y.Z` for Codex).
The nightly regen restamps a newer tag when a new tend version ships.

When the review workflow is generated, `init` also merges one ignore into
`.github/actionlint.yaml`: the workflow's `concurrency.queue` is valid GitHub
syntax that actionlint's schema rejects. The ignore applies only to generated
workflows and preserves the rest of the adopter-owned config.

Both actions run the same security and rate-limit preflight checks and
resolve bot identity. They differ in how the agent runs:

- **Claude harness** — runs the official `claude` binary headless
  (`claude -p`) as a non-sudo sandbox user behind a local
  credential-injecting proxy, so the bot token and Anthropic credential
  never enter the agent's environment. Each workflow's prompt is a slash
  command (`/tend-ci-runner:review`) that loads the matching skill.
- **Codex harness** — installs the `@openai/codex` CLI on the runner and
  shells out to `codex exec`. An AGENTS.md staged into `$CODEX_HOME`
  teaches Codex to resolve `/tend-ci-runner:NAME` references to the
  bundled skill markdown.

Edit the config or the generator — not the workflow files. They're regenerated
on every `tend@latest init`.

## Security

Tend gives Claude write access to a repository. The security model has six
layers:

**Merge restriction** is the primary boundary. A GitHub ruleset prevents the
bot from merging to protected branches — bot-authored PRs require human
approval. The bot proves this against itself on every run: preflight asks
GitHub whether the bot's own credentials can bypass any ruleset covering the
default branch (`current_user_can_bypass` — GitHub's evaluation, so teams,
custom roles, and org-level rulesets are all accounted for) and refuses to
start unless the answer is no. `tend check` verifies the setup;
`tend check --fix` creates the ruleset.

**Environment-gated credentials** — a workflow the bot can cause to run
reaches no credential: not the bot token, not the model auth, not a release
token or a trusted-publishing identity. The bot token and model auth live in
the repo's `tend` GitHub Environment, whose deployment policy admits only
the refs `tend check` confirmed the merge restriction covers, so a workflow
pushed to any other branch is refused them before its first step. The same
check sweeps every other credential-holding environment — one that stores a
secret, or that a job requesting `id-token: write` deploys to — for a gate
the bot cannot pass: a non-bot required reviewer, or a policy naming only
verified refs that no workflow reaches on a trigger the bot both fires and
steers. It flags any repo-level secret not explicitly listed in
`secrets.allowed`, where the operational names are refused outright.
`tend check --fix` creates the environment and sets its policy; moving the
secrets into it stays manual — their values can't be read back.

**Credential isolation** — the Claude harness runs the agent as a separate
non-sudo user and keeps the bot token and Anthropic credential in a local
proxy that injects them per host. The agent holds only dummies, so code
running in the session can't read the real secrets. The Codex harness passes
them directly.

**Config pinning** — the action restores `.mcp.json`, `.claude.json`,
`.gitmodules`, `.ripgreprc`, `.husky`, and every `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, and `.claude/` in the tree, at any depth, from the base branch
before the agent starts, blocking both startup-time code execution and prompt
injection from a PR's own copy of those files.

**Rate limiting** — Burst detection (10 PRs and 10 issues per 20 minutes,
checked independently) and daily spike detection halt the bot before runaway
loops cause damage.

**Fixed prompts** — Workflow prompts come from the action, not from
attacker-controlled input like PR descriptions or comments.

Full threat model: [docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md).

## Configuration

`.config/tend.yaml` — only `bot_name` is required. The default harness runs
Claude; `harness: codex` selects OpenAI Codex (see
[Harnesses](#harnesses) below).

```yaml
bot_name: my-project-bot

# Optional runtime switch — every new job skips before checkout or setup
# enabled: false

# Optional — defaults to "claude"
# harness: codex
# effort: medium   # codex only: low | medium | high | xhigh
```

Top-level `enabled: false` pauses tend from the default branch without removing
its workflows. Setting it back to `true` (or removing it) resumes new jobs
without regeneration.

The secrets, stored in the repo's `tend` environment (install-tend creates
it; `tend check` verifies it), depend on the harness:

| Harness    | Required secrets                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `claude`   | `TEND_BOT_TOKEN` + one of `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (subscription) or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (API-billed)                   |
| `codex`    | `TEND_BOT_TOKEN` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` (pay-per-token).                                                                    |

`TEND_BOT_TOKEN` is the bot account's PAT — see
[example config](docs/tend.example.yaml) for scopes.
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is from `claude setup-token`. The other two
are standard API keys from console.anthropic.com and
platform.openai.com. See [Codex (alternative)](#codex-alternative) for
why the Codex subscription `auth.json` path isn't supported;
[docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md) has the full leak
breakdown.

All other options — setup steps, protected branches, workflow overrides,
schedules — are documented in
[`docs/tend.example.yaml`](docs/tend.example.yaml).

## Project context

Tend reads `CLAUDE.md` like any Claude Code session — build commands, test
commands, project conventions all go there.

For tend-specific guidance, add a skill overlay at
`.claude/skills/running-tend/SKILL.md`. Common uses: recording which CI
workflow names `tend-ci-fix` watches, PR title conventions, label policies.

## Harnesses

Tend supports Claude and Codex. Pick whichever fits the credentials and
billing path that already work for you; both run the same workflows and
skills.

### Claude (default)

Runs the official `claude` binary headless (`claude -p`) as a non-sudo
sandbox user behind a local credential-injecting proxy: the bot token and
the Anthropic credential live only in the proxy, never in the agent's
environment. Two auth modes:

- **`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`** (recommended with a Claude
  subscription) — Claude Code OAuth token from `claude setup-token`,
  funded by the subscription's usage limits.
- **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** — standard API key from console.anthropic.com,
  billed per token against the Console org. Pick this when there's no
  Claude subscription, when the bot should bill against a dedicated
  Console org, or when per-key revocation matters.

The proxy injects whichever you set into requests to api.anthropic.com; the
agent itself only ever holds a dummy.

### Codex (alternative)

Installs `@openai/codex` on the runner and invokes `codex exec` against a
bundled `AGENTS.md` that teaches it to resolve tend's slash commands to
skill markdown.

Use `OPENAI_API_KEY` (a standard OpenAI API key, pay-per-token, from
platform.openai.com). Works for any repo, public or private.

> **Subscription `auth.json` is not supported.** Codex rotates that
> refresh token on every API call and invalidates the prior token; tend
> runs multiple workflows concurrently (review, mention, triage,
> nightly, …), so each call would invalidate the credential the other
> in-flight jobs are using. A scheduled refresher works around the
> ~8-day rotation but not the per-call invalidation between concurrent
> jobs. Use `OPENAI_API_KEY` instead.

The install-tend skill adds this automatically during setup; the kickoff
