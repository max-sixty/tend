# Continuous

> **Early development** — extracted from [worktrunk](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk)'s CI automation. Expect breaking changes.

Claude-powered CI for GitHub repos. PR review, issue triage, @bot mentions,
CI fixes, nightly sweeps, dependency updates.

## How it works

Three pieces:

1. **Composite action** (`max-sixty/continuous@v1`) — installs generic skills,
   resolves bot ID at runtime, runs Claude Code, uploads session logs. The
   stable interface.

2. **Generator** (`uvx continuous init`) — stamps out workflow files into
   `.github/workflows/`. Handles triggers, conditions, engagement verification,
   checkout. Idempotent — always overwrites from config.

3. **Config** (`.config/continuous.toml`) — bot identity, secret names, project
   setup steps. Only overrides from defaults are needed.

## Quick start

### 1. Create a bot account

Create a GitHub user account for the bot (e.g., `my-project-bot`). Generate a
classic PAT with scopes: `repo` (or fine-grained with `contents:write`,
`pull-requests:write`, `issues:write`).

### 2. Add repo secrets

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `BOT_TOKEN` | The bot account's PAT |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Claude Code OAuth token from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |

### 3. Protect the default branch

The bot must not be able to merge PRs — this is the primary security boundary.
Use a **ruleset** ("Restrict updates" on the default branch, only admins
bypass) or **branch protection** (require reviews, don't exempt the bot).
See [docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md) for details.

### 4. Add config

Create `.config/continuous.toml`:

```toml
bot_name = "my-project-bot"
```

This generates all six workflows using default secret names (`BOT_TOKEN`,
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`). If the repo's default branch isn't `main`, set
`default_branch`:

```toml
bot_name = "my-project-bot"
default_branch = "master"
```

Override secret names if yours differ:

```toml
bot_name = "my-project-bot"

[secrets]
bot_token = "MY_BOT_PAT"
claude_token = "MY_CLAUDE_TOKEN"
```

### 5. Generate and commit

```bash
uvx continuous init
uvx continuous check          # verify branch protection, secrets, bot access
git add .github/workflows/continuous-*.yaml .config/continuous.toml
git commit -m "Add continuous workflows"
git push
```

### 6. Add project context (recommended)

Without project-specific guidance, Claude uses only the generic CI skills. For
better results, add a `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with build commands, test commands,
and project conventions. For detailed per-workflow guidance, add a skill overlay
(see [Customization](#customization)).

## Customization

### Project setup steps

Build tools, caches, and environment variables run before Claude in every
workflow. Define them in config:

```toml
[setup]
uses = ["./.github/actions/my-setup"]
run = ["echo CARGO_TERM_COLOR=always >> $GITHUB_ENV"]
```

### Workflow overrides

```toml
[workflows.ci-fix]
watched_workflows = ["ci", "build"]   # which workflows trigger ci-fix

[workflows.nightly]
cron = "0 8 * * *"                    # override default schedule
prompt = "/my-custom-nightly"         # override the default prompt

[workflows.renovate]
enabled = false                       # disable a workflow entirely
```

### Project-specific skills

The generic `continuous-*` skills handle CI patterns. Project-specific behavior
(test commands, review criteria, labels) goes in a skill overlay in the
adopter's repo — e.g., `.claude/skills/running-continuous/SKILL.md`. This skill
can reference the generic skills and add project conventions.

## What's generated

All six workflows are enabled by default. Disable individual workflows with
`enabled = false` in config.

| Workflow | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `continuous-review` | PR opened/updated, review submitted |
| `continuous-mention` | @bot mentions, engaged conversations |
| `continuous-triage` | Issue opened |
| `continuous-ci-fix` | CI fails on default branch |
| `continuous-nightly` | Daily schedule, manual dispatch |
| `continuous-renovate` | Weekly schedule, manual dispatch |
