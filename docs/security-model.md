# CI Automation Security Model

Tend gives an AI agent write access to a repository and runs it on
attacker-controlled input (PR diffs, issue bodies, comments, CI logs). The
agent uses authenticated GitHub and model connections to push commits, post
reviews, and create PRs. The security model keeps the PAT and long-lived model
credentials outside the agent process. Merge authority is explicit: the
default mode requires a maintainer, while yolo lets the bot merge ordinary
code but keeps the repository control plane maintainer-owned. The agent is expected to use the GitHub
API for any repository the bot account can access, including repositories
other than the one that started the run.

Each adopting repo should document its specific configuration (admin accounts,
token names, protected environments) in its own
`.claude/skills/running-tend/SKILL.md`, the adopter-owned overlay the rest of
the docs name. Not a `docs/agent-notes.md` of its own: PR instruction
pinning covers `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, and
`.agents/` at any depth under both harnesses
(`shared/steps/restore-sensitive-config.sh`), so notes parked outside those
paths are read from the PR's own tree.

## Threats

Three things an attacker wants, roughly in order of severity:

1. **Merge malicious code to the default branch.** Game over — the attacker
   controls the repo. Everything else is damage limitation compared to this.

2. **Exfiltrate tokens.** Code running inside the agent must cross the UID
   boundary or compromise a runner-owned proxy to steal the bot PAT or API
   credentials. Subscription consumers do receive an expiring access token,
   but never its rotating refresh token. A stolen PAT grants persistent GitHub
   access; stolen model auth grants billed model access.

3. **Hijack a single session.** An attacker who controls what the agent does
   in one run can push malicious branches, post misleading reviews, or create
   spam PRs.

The attack surface varies by workflow. `tend-review` is the most exposed —
the attacker controls the entire PR diff, which Claude reads and reasons
about. `tend-weekly` is the least exposed — triggered on a cron with no
user-controlled input.

The merge rulesets, environment gates, credential isolation, and fixed
prompts apply to every workflow; the table lists what is specific to each.

| Workflow | Injection surface | Attacker control | Specific mitigations |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **review** | PR diff content, review body on bot PRs | Full (any PR) / Medium (reviewers) | Base-branch config restoration |
| **triage** | Issue body | Partial (structured skill) | Structured skill |
| **mention** | Comment body on any issue/PR | Full | Engagement verification; review events re-entered via a secretless relay |
| **ci-fix** | Unsuccessful CI logs | Minimal (must disrupt CI on default branch) | Automatic trigger |
| **weekly** | None | None | Scheduled trigger |

## What we do

Three load-bearing boundaries, with one deliberate policy choice:

1. **Merge authority is explicit.** Under the default `maintainer` mode, the
   bot cannot update the default branch. Under `yolo`, it can merge ordinary
   PRs but cannot push directly; changes to `.github/**` or
   `.config/tend.yaml` still need fresh CODEOWNER approval. Extra protected
   branches and tags remain admin-only in both policies.
2. **A run the bot can cause cannot extract protected secrets.** Generic
   credentials sit behind a gate the bot cannot pass, or are explicitly
   allowlisted as accepted repo-level exposure. Tend's own environment is the
   deliberate yolo exception: Tend verifies the exact generated workflows,
   reserves this environment for them, and rejects other workflows whose
   environment use is dynamic or hidden in an external or ref-qualified
   reusable workflow.
   Their harness isolates the long-lived credentials from agent code.
3. **Future published releases cannot be rewritten.** GitHub immutable
   releases lock the release record, its assets, and the associated tag from
   the point the repository setting is enabled.

`tend check` fails until the first two hold and the third is enabled, so a
passing check *is* the claim for future releases. GitHub does not apply the
setting retroactively.

**Merge rulesets.** Tend separates default-branch merge access from protection of
other long-lived refs. `Merge access` targets only the default branch. In
`maintainer`, only admins bypass its update rule. In `yolo`, the bot user also gets
GitHub's `pull_request` bypass mode: it may update the branch through a PR but
not by direct push. `Protected branch access` targets only configured
`protected_branches` and stays admin-only. Both rulesets protect ref creation,
updates, and deletion, so a bot cannot delete and recreate an admitted ref.
The composite action verifies the bot's exact effective answer from
`current_user_can_bypass`: `never` for maintainer, `pull_requests_only` for yolo.

Yolo adds `Control-plane review`, a default-branch pull-request rule that the
bot cannot bypass. `tend init` puts a managed block last in the effective
CODEOWNERS file, assigning `/.github/**`, `/.config/tend.yaml`, and every
possible CODEOWNERS location to `control_plane_owner`. The block also covers
every `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`,
`.claude/`, and `.agents/` path because these files steer later agent runs. The owner must be one
maintainer GitHub user distinct from the bot. Protecting the ownership files
themselves prevents the bot from replacing the effective one before changing
another control-plane path. GitHub therefore admits ordinary PRs with zero
blanket approvals, but requires a fresh owner approval for control-plane
changes. Stale approvals are dismissed on push. Tend enables the
yolo bypass only after `tend check` sees that CODEOWNERS block on the default
branch. The exact-workflow check reconstructs the same repository owner,
default branch, and config path that `tend init` used, so it compares the files
against the output that belongs in this repository rather than generic
generator defaults.

**Environment-gated secrets.** A job that names a GitHub Environment runs
only if the run's `GITHUB_REF` matches the environment's deployment branch
policy; otherwise the job is refused before its first step, and the
environment's secrets are released only to jobs that name it. Pinning the
policy to authorized refs therefore decides secret access by ref. In maintainer
mode those are refs the bot cannot move. In yolo, Tend's own environment also
admits the default branch because generated workflows run there; that is safe
only in conjunction with the control-plane rule and the harness's credential
isolation. Generic credential environments do not inherit that exception: a
default-branch policy is insufficient in yolo and they need a non-bot required
reviewer. Tags remain admin-only, and managing environments requires admin,
which the bot lacks.

The claim in sentence 2 is the conjunction of three checks, each keyed on
where a credential can live:

- *Every credential-holding environment is gated*
  (`credential-environments`): a required reviewer who is not the bot, or
  a deployment policy naming only verified refs — branches the same run
  confirmed the bot cannot write, or tags under an admin-only all-tags
  ruleset — with no workflow reaching it on a trigger the bot steers. This
  covers release tokens exactly as it covers tend's own secrets, keyed on
  holding a credential rather than on any environment name. A credential
  is a stored secret, or the OIDC token a job minting `id-token: write`
  in the environment's name can spend: trusted publishing (PyPI, npm, a
  cloud role) stores nothing, so a sweep reading stored secrets alone
  walks past exactly the repos that publish.
- *No repo-level secret outside the allowlist* (`repo-secret-allowlist`):
  a repo-level secret is readable by any workflow the repo runs, so each
  one must be a deliberate `secrets.allowed` entry — and the operational
  names are refused there at config load, so no one config line can
  reopen the gate. Org-level secrets are swept into the same check
  best-effort: they cannot be environment-gated at all, and listing them
  needs `admin:org`, the one place the claim rests on the token the
  maintainer ran `tend check` with. Only the org secrets this repo can
  actually read count — one scoped away from it (`selected` without the
  repo, `private` against a public repo, any of them against a private
  repo in a GitHub Free org) reaches no workflow here, and naming it
  would leave a failure no repo-side change can clear. A secret whose
  reach cannot be determined is reported rather than dropped.
- *The operational secrets actually live in the gated environment*
  (`environment`, `secrets`): the `tend` policy admits exactly the
  verified branches, and the bot PAT and harness auth are present there
  rather than anywhere flatter.

What a pushed workflow holds, then, is only what GitHub gives every run:
its ephemeral `GITHUB_TOKEN`, at whatever permissions the file declares —
bounded by the repository rulesets, unable to read any secret value back
through the API, and expiring with the job. Yolo's PR-only bypass belongs to
the PAT-authenticated Tend bot instead: it can merge ordinary code, but
control-plane paths still require a CODEOWNER and tags remain admin-only.

*Operational secrets* — the bot PAT, harness auth, the Codex subscription
refresher's credential, and optional auto-memory Gist ID — live in the `tend`
environment, whose policy names the default branch and any
`protected_branches`. Every generated job that reads a secret carries
`environment: {name: tend, deployment: false}`; jobs that hold none
(mention's relay, below) must not, since naming it would cost them the refs
the policy excludes. `deployment: false` keeps GitHub from filing a
deployment record for a job that deploys nothing — under
`pull_request_target` those land on the pull request itself, one line per
push — and leaves the policy check untouched. This closes
the classic no-merge exfiltration: a write-scoped actor (a leaked PAT, or a
hijacked session that can push a branch) commits a workflow that prints the
secrets and reads them from its own run. Branch protection never touched
that path — it bounds what gets *merged*, not what a run can *read* — but
the environment does: the pushed workflow's run carries the branch's own
ref, and the job naming the environment fails with zero steps executed
(observed on a live probe).

Where each trigger runs. A ✓ row was observed on a live probe; the rest
carry the ref of the family they belong to and were not probed
individually. GitHub's "runs in the context of the default branch"
sentence for review events refers to which workflow *file* runs, not to
`GITHUB_REF` — which is why the review rows had to be measured rather than
read off the docs:

| Trigger | `GITHUB_REF` | `tend` gate | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `issue_comment`, `repository_dispatch` | default branch | passes | ✓ |
| `issues`, `schedule`, `workflow_run` | default branch | passes | |
| `pull_request_target` | PR base branch | passes for admitted bases | ✓ |
| `push` to a feature branch | that branch | refused | ✓ |
| same-repo `pull_request` | `refs/pull/N/merge` | refused | |
| `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment` | `refs/pull/N/merge` | refused | ✓ |

The `pull_request_target` refusal on other bases is itself load-bearing:
that event runs the *base* ref's workflow file, so a PR targeting a
bot-pushable branch would execute whatever tend-review.yaml that branch
carries, with the secrets. The cost is that a stacked PR — one based on
another PR's branch — gets no review until it retargets an admitted
branch; the refused run fails visibly rather than skipping. (The probe
observed the default-base case; the base-ref value is GitHub's documented
`GITHUB_REF` for the event, and the refusal is the mechanism the `push`
row measures.)

Only one workflow legitimately needs a refused ref: tend-mention answers
review submissions and inline review comments. The merge ref can
never be admitted, because a same-repo `pull_request` run executes the PR
head's own workflow files on that same ref — admitting it would hand a
pushed workflow the secrets back. So tend-mention re-enters those events
instead: a secretless `relay` job (only the workflow-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN`,
`contents: write`, which is what the dispatch POST requires — `read` is
refused 403, probed) receives the review event and re-posts it as a
`repository_dispatch` carrying identifiers only (`{kind, pr, id}`). The
dispatch run carries the default branch, passes the gate, and its verify
job re-reads the review or comment from the API before applying the
engagement checks. Any write-scoped actor can forge such a dispatch, which
is why the payload carries no judgement: a forged dispatch runs the same
reviewed workflow file, faces the same engagement checks against the record
GitHub holds, and can point the bot at nothing the actor couldn't reach by
posting a comment.

The relay stops at the repository boundary. A review event on a *fork* PR
does start a run, on the merge ref and from the PR head's own workflow
files, but that run's token is read-only whatever the file asks for: probed
with `contents: write` declared, its `POST /repos/…/dispatches` still
returns 403, where the same request from a same-repo run with the same
permission succeeds. So a fork PR's reviews reach the bot through the
notifications poll, minutes later rather than seconds. The daily live scan is
the slower backstop for a missed notification. That is the cost of the
property the relay depends on: a fork run that could start a secret-bearing
run in the base repo would be a fork run with write access to it.

*Release secrets* (registry tokens, signing keys) use the same mechanism in
adopter-owned environments whose policies list the default branch and/or
all tags (a tag-target ruleset gates `creation` and `update` with
admin-only bypass; `update` is what force-push of an existing tag fires, so
it must be blocked alongside `creation`). Rulesets are the only mechanism —
GitHub sunset tag protection rules in 2024 — and the `creation` rule also
refuses `POST /repos/{repo}/releases` when the named tag does not exist
yet, so the Releases API is not a way around it. The
`credential-environments` sweep above verifies every such environment.

Immutable releases close the separate write path: once a release is published,
GitHub locks its assets and associated tag. This is a repository setting, not a
ruleset inference; `tend check` verifies it directly and `--fix` enables it.
The setting is prospective, so enable it before the repository's next release.
It does not make `release: published` safe for secrets: a write actor
can still publish a new release against an existing unpublished tag.

The gate bounds what a run can *read*; it does not by itself bound *when*
a reviewed workflow fires. A workflow reachable only by updating a gated
ref (`push: tags:` for release, `push: branches: [main]` for continuous
deploy) is fully chained: causing the run at all takes an admin action, and
the code the run executes is fixed by the ref, so the worst a write-scoped
bot achieves is re-publishing what an admin already published. `schedule`,
`workflow_run`, `deployment` and an input-free `workflow_dispatch` sit in
that class too.

Three triggers do not, because the bot supplies the run's payload as well
as firing it, and it fires them at a ref the policy already admits:
`release: published` (creating a release against an existing tag takes no
tag operation, and the release's body and assets are the bot's own),
`repository_dispatch` (`client_payload` wholesale), and a
`workflow_dispatch` carrying inputs. A ref policy cannot gate these; only a
required reviewer can, since it holds every trigger regardless of ref. The
sweep therefore refuses a ref-gated environment that a workflow reaches on
one of the three. A workflow that must run on one puts its secrets in a
second environment behind a required reviewer instead of a branch policy,
so each run waits for a maintainer; the sweep verifies any such environment,
keyed on the credential rather than the name, with the bot excluded from
the reviewer list since a bot that can approve its own run makes the wait
a formality.

An OIDC publish or deploy (PyPI or npm trusted publishing, a cloud role)
stores no secret, so the environment is the whole gate on GitHub's side —
the token's `sub` names it, and a relying party can require that claim. A
job holding `id-token: write` outside any environment has no gate at all:
the token carries no environment claim, and the bot can mint it from a
branch it pushes, which any trust policy pinning the repository but not the
ref accepts. The sweep covers both cases: an environment a job mints OIDC
in holds a credential even with nothing stored in it, and a job minting one
outside any environment is reported on its own. Tend's own generated
workflows request no `id-token`.

*Migration.* Environment secrets overlay repo-level ones, and a job naming
an environment that does not yet exist auto-creates it with no policy and
runs normally (observed on a live probe). A repo that has not completed the
migration therefore keeps working on its repo-level secrets, with exactly
its old exposure — the gate protects nothing until the policy is set, the
secrets are moved, and the repo-level copies are deleted. `tend check`
fails on each missing piece until then: it verifies the environment exists,
its policy is a named list matching exactly the branches that same run
confirmed for Tend's runtime, the operational secrets are present in it, and no
repo-level copy remains. Confirmed, not configured: a branch named in
`protected_branches` that does not exist yet cannot be admitted, or the
policy would claim safety for a ref whose live protection cannot be checked.
The canonical ruleset still blocks its future creation, update, and deletion.
`tend check --fix` creates the environment and reconciles its policy; moving
the secrets stays manual, since their values cannot be read back.

The policy must be that named list rather than GitHub's "protected
branches" mode, which keys on whether *a* rule covers the branch and not on
who may push it. Probed: with that mode selected, a branch protected only
by `required_linear_history` — which blocks no push — took a plain push and
then read an environment secret, while an unprotected branch was refused
with zero steps.

Both environment chains assume the bot remains at write permission; an admin
bot voids their ruleset and reviewer boundaries. Configuration recipe:
`plugins/install-tend/skills/install-tend/references/security-model.md`.

Everything else in this section is defense in depth: useful, but not
load-bearing.

### Agent execution boundary

The harness has four states and only four transitions:

| State | Runner checkout | Disposable checkout | Sandbox processes | Allowed next step |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **trusted setup** | runner-owned, reviewed base | absent | none | clone |
| **prepared** | unchanged | runner-owned, exact event topology, startup config pinned | none | launch |
| **running** | unreadable and unwritable to the payload | sandbox-owned | one SRT process tree | reap |
| **quiescent** | unchanged | no live writer | none | bounded export |

Each transition is a bottleneck with one job:

- **Content ingress** creates a full remote clone inside a dedicated `/tmp`
  container with no hardlinks or object-store alternates and with runner/system
  Git config and attributes disabled. It selects the exact base, PR merge/head,
  or open-PR head ref, pins startup configuration to the exact chosen base
  commit, removes the temporary credential, makes the otherwise-empty parent
  traversable but not listable, then changes ownership of that clone only.
  `RUNNER_TEMP` remains unreadable except for the exact read-only event payload
  named by `GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`. SRT, the Codex binaries, and the immutable agent
  environment live in one dedicated runner-owned, sandbox-readable runtime
  directory; the sandbox cannot write it.
- **Launch and lifetime** invokes the adopter's `sandbox_setup:` and the whole
  Claude or Codex turn as one command under the pinned Anthropic Sandbox
  Runtime. Tend supplies absolute `node`, `bwrap`, `socat`, `rg`, and seccomp
  paths, treats dependency warnings as fatal, and probes AF_UNIX denial plus
  runner-checkout unreadability before setup executes. The hosted integration
  probe additionally asserts that direct host loopback is unreachable while
  the HTTP broker remains reachable. Ubuntu 24.04's AppArmor policy strips the
  user-namespace capabilities SRT needs. Tend temporarily applies SRT's
  documented sysctl prerequisite on disposable GitHub-hosted VMs and restores
  it immediately after the sandbox is reaped; Tend never changes self-hosted
  policy, where a scoped AppArmor profile may satisfy the same prerequisite.
  Without either, the run fails closed inside `bwrap` with `Failed
  RTM_NEWADDR: Operation not permitted`, rather than with a capability
  diagnosis.
- **Authority brokerage** leaves long-lived credentials in runner-owned
  proxies. SRT supplies the isolated network namespace and routes HTTP through
  Tend's credential proxy; the agent gets dummy credentials. Codex and Claude
  do not add a second nested filesystem sandbox.
- **Result export** begins only after SRT exits and the sandbox UID has no live
  process. The supervisor reads fixed result and skill-summary files, and the
  later token step copies bounded session data, all through no-follow reads;
  the agent never receives GitHub's command-file paths. Codex then stops its
  runner-owned Responses proxy, and one fixed cleanup deletes both the event
  checkout and the per-run SRT/package directory before restoring any
  temporary GitHub-hosted runner policy. Subsequent steps consume the bounded
  exports or the sandbox user's session tree; none executes from the event
  checkout or the deleted runtime.

The Actions checkout is therefore orchestration state, not an agent
workspace. Local `setup:` composites and all their POST chains continue to see
the same reviewed tree, so Tend no longer checks out a PR over them and no
longer needs a post-agent restore or recursive ownership repair.

**Action distribution integrity.** Generated workflows pin the composite
action to the generator's own release version
(`max-sixty/tend/<harness>@X.Y.Z`), never a floating ref. Release-tag
immutability is the boundary this relies on for new releases: GitHub's
immutable-releases setting locks each release, its assets, and its tag when it
is published. The tag ruleset also restricts updates. Tend's releases from
before the setting was enabled have no uploaded assets and their tag code is
protected by a no-bypass tag ruleset, but their GitHub release records are not
retroactively immutable. The separate all-tags ruleset prevents the bot from
creating or repointing any release tag, so a leaked bot token or hijacked
session cannot change the action code every adopter already runs. Adopters
extend trust to `max-sixty/tend`'s release-tag integrity the same way they
trust any third-party action's publisher; pinning to `X.Y.Z` (or a commit
SHA) bounds that trust to a reviewed, immutable point.

**Config pinning.** Before the agent starts, both harnesses restore every
`CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.override.md`, `.claude/`,
and `.agents/` at any depth from the PR base branch. Their CLIs load nearby
instruction files and skills from those directories. Both harnesses also restore RCE-relevant config
at the root: `.mcp.json`, `.claude.json`, `.gitmodules`, `.ripgreprc`, and
`.husky`. A malicious PR's `SessionStart` hook, MCP server, or injected skill
is reverted before an agent reads it. The restoration is
`git restore --source=<exact base commit>` in shell:
base-branch versions are written back, fork-added paths removed, and a
fork-planted symlink replaced rather than written through. The root path list
and ordering mirror claude-code-action's `restore-config.ts`. The PR's own
versions stay readable at `git show HEAD:<path>` for a review that wants to see
what it changed; nothing copies them into the worktree, since a copy made by
the runner user would follow a fork-planted symlink into files the agent must
never see, such as the checkout credential in `.git/config`.

**Setup runs on reviewed code.** Adopter `setup:` steps execute as the runner
user against the stable Actions checkout: the default branch, or in
`tend-review` the PR's reviewed base. That tree is never replaced or handed to
the agent, and files `setup:` writes there do not appear in the independent
agent checkout. A contributor's build backend and dependencies therefore
execute only from the disposable event checkout, through `sandbox_setup:` or
the agent itself, inside SRT. Both harnesses run `sandbox_setup:` as the
non-sudo sandbox user in the same SRT process lifetime as the agent.

Yolo refuses all runner-side `setup:` because ordinary code merged by the bot
could steer even a fixed command running against the default branch. It also
refuses workflow and job overrides so credential-bearing jobs retain their
audited shape.

After SRT exits, the trusted supervisor kills and verifies the complete sandbox
UID process tree, then copies only size-bounded fixed outputs. The next fixed
action step deletes the dedicated `/tmp/tend-agent-workspace-*` container; no
post-sandbox step executes a file from that checkout.

**Credential isolation.** Both harness actions run the agent as a separate
non-sudo `tend-sandbox` user, sharing the GitHub proxy machinery under the
top-level `proxy/`. The bot PAT lives only in a local mitmproxy that the agent
reaches over `HTTPS_PROXY`; the proxy injects it only for exact GitHub hosts
and tunnels everything else. This authenticates API and git operations for any
repository the bot account can access; credential isolation protects the PAT
itself rather than restricting those operations to the triggering repository.
Claude's Anthropic credential (OAuth token or API key) uses the same proxy and
is injected only for `api.anthropic.com`. Under API auth, Codex's OpenAI key is
instead read from stdin by OpenAI's hardened Responses API proxy. It forwards
only `POST /v1/responses` upstream and answers `GET /shutdown` on loopback so
Tend can stop it during teardown. The agent holds only a dummy PAT and the
local inference endpoint. Under subscription auth, it additionally receives an
expiring access-only `auth.json`, but not the rotating refresh token. A
different UID with no sudo cannot read either proxy's
`/proc/<pid>/environ`; the runner checkout and its persisted checkout
credential never enter the sandbox; and the PAT and API credentials are never
written to the agent's env or disk. The injection
allowlist is exact-match on the connection's real destination, so a request to
a lookalike host gets no token. The GitHub proxy is launched by a pinned `uv`
that Tend installs into its own directory, off `$PATH`, so the process holding the PAT
starts from a known binary rather than whatever an adopter's
`setup:` happened to leave on the runner. (`claude` is Node and ignores the
system trust store, so it trusts the proxy CA via `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`.) Shared
system and hosted-toolcache PATH entries remain available to the sandbox. Tend
appends a pinned `uv` fallback after those paths before `sandbox_setup:` runs. A
runner-home PATH entry may select an independently seeded directory already
owned by the sandbox user; runner-home files themselves stay off the sandbox
PATH. Tend does not infer which files under the
runner home are runtimes rather than secrets; later home-scoped changes must be
made as the sandbox user with `sandbox_setup:`. A generic failure shim keeps a
dropped home-selected command from silently falling through to a different
same-named system tool.

**Session-log upload.** The token-usage step uploads the agent's session JSONL
only after the SRT process tree and sandbox UID are quiescent. One privileged
helper opens every source component and descendant relative to no-follow file
descriptors, copies regular files only, and enforces per-file, total-byte, and
file-count bounds. Symlinks, devices, and FIFOs never enter the runner-owned
artifact tree.

The weekly subscription refresh job checks out no adopter code and gives Codex
only Tend's fixed refresh prompt. Codex receives the full refresh bundle there;
the environment-write PAT appears only in the separate publish step after
Codex exits.

**Rate limiting.** Burst detection (10 PRs or issues per 20 minutes) and
spike detection (today's volume vs 6-day baseline, scaled per repo) abort
the run before the agent starts, catching runaway loops between workflows.
The check runs as its own step in the composite action, so a
prompt-injection attack inside the agent session cannot skip it. Concrete limits live in
`shared/steps/rate_limit_preflight.py`.

The spike limit is resumable by a maintainer, the burst limit is not. On a
spike trip the run files or reopens a `tend-rate-limit` issue listing the
runs it refused; closing that issue doubles the ceiling for the rest of the
UTC day, and each further close doubles it again, so the limit re-arms
after use rather than switching off. Approval is a check rather than an
instruction: the preflight counts only closes whose actor is not the bot,
and since GitHub admits only the author or a triage/write collaborator to
close an issue — and the bot is the author — that leaves exactly the
maintainers. The bot cannot approve itself even if a prompt injection tells
it to, and there is no allowlist to maintain.

Refused runs do not retry on their own; the issue's table carries their
links. Automating that is deferred (see `TODO.md`).

**Fixed prompts and marketplace skills.** The prompt and skill set come from
the composite action and the tend marketplace, not from the PR. An attacker
can influence what the agent *reads* (the diff, the issue body) but not the
*instructions* it follows or the *tools* it has access to.

**GitHub's log masking.** Secrets stored in GitHub are automatically redacted
from workflow logs. This is exact-match only — if a token appears
base64-encoded or embedded in JSON, the redaction misses it.

## Remaining risks

**The agent executes attacker-controlled code.** This remains expected behavior.
When an agent runs tests or build commands on a fork PR, it executes code the
attacker wrote. A `Makefile`, `package.json` postinstall hook, or
`conftest.py` can do anything the sandbox user can and send data over the
network. It cannot read the PAT or API credentials; subscription mode's
expiring access token is the deliberate exception described below. Config
pinning prevents
*Claude Code's own* startup hooks from being hijacked, but it can't prevent
an agent from voluntarily running `make test` on a repo where `make test` has
been weaponized. Anthropic Sandbox Runtime contains that process tree to the
disposable checkout, sandbox home, scratch paths, and brokered network. This
protects the runner checkout and host authority; it does not make the checked
out repository content confidential or prevent the agent from deliberately
publishing content it can read.

**Write access still starts workflows.** With the operational secrets
environment-gated, a write-scoped actor can no longer read them out of a
workflow it pushes; what it keeps is invocation. It can post the comments
and reviews that wake the bot, and it can forge the `repository_dispatch`
that tend-mention's relay uses — both start only the default branch's
reviewed workflow files, with the engagement checks applied to the record
GitHub holds rather than to the payload.

**Data exfiltration via side channels.** An attacker who gets code execution
can exfiltrate repository contents and agent-visible context via DNS queries,
HTTP requests to an external server, or workflow logs. SRT removes direct
network access, but Tend's HTTP broker currently tunnels arbitrary destinations
because the agent needs general package and GitHub access; destination
allowlisting is deferred. Credential isolation keeps the PAT and API
credentials out of what a hijacked session can send. A Codex subscription
session can send its expiring access token, but it never receives the rotating
refresh token or the PAT that rewrites environment secrets.

**Credential theft.** Isolation minimizes the chance that a hijacked session
can steal the long-lived tokens, but it does not protect against compromise of
the runner-owned proxy or the runner itself. A stolen classic PAT remains valid
until revoked and grants access to every repository both its scope and the bot
account can reach. A stolen subscription access token remains valid until it
expires. Under maintainer mode, the merge restriction prevents that credential
from landing code. Under yolo, it can land ordinary code by design, while the
control-plane rule, environment gates, and immutable releases still prevent
repository takeover and release rewriting unless one of those runner-owned
boundaries is separately compromised.

**Prompt injection without code execution.** Even without hijacking the
tools, an attacker who controls what Claude reads can influence its behavior.
A carefully crafted PR description or issue body could get Claude to approve a
bad PR, post misleading comments, or dismiss legitimate review concerns. Fixed
prompts and skill instructions reduce this risk but can't eliminate it —
Claude ultimately reasons about attacker-controlled text.

**Persistent auto memory.** The experimental `memory_gist: true` setting lets
Claude carry model-authored notes into unrelated later runs. Those notes are
context, not policy, and may preserve stale facts or the effect of an earlier
prompt injection. The adapter accepts only a bot-owned secret Gist bound to the
exact repository, signs its per-run baseline, rejects symlinks and nested paths,
and skips the entire save when it observes a conflict. A secret Gist is readable
to anyone who learns its URL, so the Gist ID stays out of committed public files
and the experiment is refused for private repositories. It is not hidden from
the session: the agent's proxied bot access can list the account's Gists.

Deferred hardening options (Haiku pre-screening, read-only fork PRs, and
outbound destination allowlisting) live in `TODO.md`.
